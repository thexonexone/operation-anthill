/// What a reader is told about a route must be what a caller would use. v0.3.8.41.
///
/// FOUND ON A RUNNING COLONY, not in review. Booting this project's own machine printed seven of
/// these:
///
/// <code>
/// [model-fitness] role 'coder' is routed to ollama:, which is missing: structured output; reasoning
/// </code>
///
/// Note `ollama:` with nothing after the colon — and `llama3.1:8b` installed, pulled, and serving
/// requests. The report was grading the capabilities of a model whose name is the empty string.
/// `builder` came back FIT from that same empty string, because its only requirement is a context
/// window and an unknown window is deliberately not reported as too small. So the output was a
/// function of each role's REQUIREMENTS and nothing else: it would have printed the identical seven
/// lines on a host with no Ollama at all, and on a host with the perfect model.
///
/// THE CAUSE was two halves of one decision living apart. `ResolveRoute` answers "what is
/// configured", which v3.8.33 made legitimately empty when nobody has chosen a model. `GetClient`
/// then resolved the real model on the call path — catalogue default, then the sole-installed-model
/// rule. Everything that DISPLAYED a route read the first; everything that CALLED a model used the
/// second; nothing made them agree.
///
/// This is the eleventh instance of this repository's signature defect — a check answering a
/// question adjacent to the one asked, and passing — and the second time in THIS report
/// specifically. v3.8.2 fixed it when fitness read the declared capability table instead of the
/// discovered one. It came back through a different door as soon as an empty model became legal,
/// which is the argument for a shared resolution rather than a second careful reader.
/// </summary>
// Serialised with the other tests that mutate model settings. `WithNoConfiguredModel` writes
// `AnthillRuntime.OllamaModel`, which is process-global, and `RouteModelDefaultTests` writes it
// through the settings path — two classes doing that in parallel is a flake nobody can reproduce.
