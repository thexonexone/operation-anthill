/// The order of finalization, and the fact that it happens once. v0.3.8.41.
///
/// TWO DEFECTS, ONE SHAPE. Both are producer/consumer orderings where the consumer ran first and
/// nothing failed:
///
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item><b>Learning consumed the archivist's output before the archivist ran.</b>
///   <c>LearningRecorder.RegisterProceduralRoutes</c> queries the mission's <c>memory_candidate</c>
///   events; it was called from <c>FinalizeMission</c>, and the archivist runs after that returns.
///   The query has therefore returned an empty list on every mission this project has ever run.
///   v2.26.0 moved route registration to finalization to fix an earlier version of the same bug and
///   landed one step short, because the producer had no trigger yet; v3.8.26 gave the archivist a
///   trigger and put it AFTER the consumer.</item>
/// <item><b>Finalization could run twice.</b> Pheromone strength and skill observations are
///   cumulative, so a recovery pass over an already-finalised mission does not produce a slightly
///   stale answer — it produces a permanently doubled one, and afterwards nothing distinguishes
///   "succeeded twice" from "counted twice".</item>
/// </list>
///
/// The ledger tests below are behavioural against a real store. The ordering tests read the source,
/// because the property is about the sequence of two calls in one method and a behavioural test
/// would need a fake for each of the three services — at which point it would be asserting the order
/// of the fakes.
