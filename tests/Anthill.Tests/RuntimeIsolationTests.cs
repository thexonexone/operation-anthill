/// v3.1.0 — ADR-001's exit gate: "Two runtime instances can execute tests in the same process
/// without configuration leakage."
///
/// This is the test the phase exists to make writable. Before the refactor it could not be
/// expressed at all: a Queen read <c>EnableModelRouting</c>, <c>UseOllama</c>,
/// <c>EnableFileTools</c> and <c>EnableFileWriting</c> out of mutable statics during
/// construction, so "two Queens with different configuration" was not a thing that could exist —
/// the second one to be built simply overwrote what the first had been told. That is why the
/// suite grew <c>[Collection("Autonomy")]</c> and <c>[Collection("specialist-gates")]</c>
/// attributes, and why an assembly-wide parallelisation ban was eventually needed on top of them.
///
/// Note what is NOT claimed here. These tests share a process with the rest of the suite, which
/// still mutates globals, so they build their hosts from EXPLICIT options rather than from the
/// ambient runtime. That is the point: a host composed from explicit options is immune to what
/// the statics are doing, and that immunity is exactly what the exit gate asks for.
///
/// v3.8.16 — the gate survived the tools leaving the core, but not for free, and the failure was
/// worth having. Six tools moved to <c>Anthill.Modules.Tools</c>, taking with them the registration
/// gating that used to read each host's own <see cref="RuntimeOptions"/>. The module gates on
/// <c>IToolRuntimeOptions</c>, and the production roots hand it the AMBIENT runtime — right for a
/// process with one colony, wrong for this file. These tests now compose the way a multi-host root
/// would have to: <see cref="HostGates"/> presents each host's own options to its own module
/// instance. Left alone, they would have gone green with both hosts having no file tools at all.
