/// A changelog entry that has SHIPPED is frozen. v0.3.8.37.

/// THE MISTAKE THIS EXISTS FOR, MADE THREE TIMES
/// ---------------------------------------------
/// While a release is in flight, new work gets written into the changelog's top entry. Then that
/// entry ships — and now the tagged release describes code it does not contain. It happened at
/// v3.8.33, at v0.3.8.34 and again at v0.3.8.35, each time caught by hand afterwards, twice only
/// because someone went looking.
///
/// It is the same defect this repository keeps finding everywhere else, turned on the record itself:
/// a document that confidently describes something that is not true. `CHANGELOG.md` is the only
/// place that answers "what is in this release", and an entry edited after tagging answers it
/// wrongly and looks deliberate doing so.
///
/// Process notes did not fix it. Three releases of "be careful" produced three failures, so this is
/// the executable version.
///
/// WHY THIS ONE NEEDS GIT
/// ----------------------
/// Every other guard here reads the working tree, because the property is visible in the tree. This
/// property is a DIFFERENCE — entry text now versus entry text at the tag — and nothing in the
/// working tree records it. So the check shells out to git and SKIPS cleanly when git or the tags
/// are unavailable (a shallow CI clone, an exported archive).
///
/// A skip is honest here rather than a hole: the mistake is made while editing locally, which is
/// exactly where the tags exist and the check runs.
