/// Stage F — the full-roster qualification fixture. v3.8.29.
///
/// The plan's requirement is precise and worth quoting: "CI should require all twelve to report Ready
/// under the full-roster qualification fixture." NOT "the default flips to full" — the default stays
/// `core`, and flipping it is an operator's deliberate act. What CI must guarantee is that when an
/// operator DOES flip it, every role can actually run.
///
/// This is the fixture. It resolves the roster exactly as `ProjectConfig` does, then asks each role
/// the same questions `/colony` reports — handler, contract, tools registered, capabilities grantable
/// — and fails naming the first binding reason.
///
/// Deliberately NOT a live mission. A test that ran twelve roles against a real model would be slow,
/// non-deterministic and dependent on a provider being up; it would fail for reasons that are not
/// about qualification and would be disabled within a month. What this proves is that nothing
/// STRUCTURAL stops the roster — which is the half a test can honestly own. The other half is a real
/// run, and that belongs to the operator.
