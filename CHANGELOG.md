# ANTHILL Changelog

## v1.8.27.1 — Coder add-vs-modify: apply patches to existing files

Auto-apply repeatedly stalled with `ADD refused because file already exists`: the coder frequently
proposed `change_type: add` for a file that already exists, and the apply tool hard-refused. Two-part
fix so real self-improvement patches land:

- **Coder prompt (`Ants.cs`):** choose `change_type` by whether the target file exists — `modify`
  (with exact `old_content`) for existing files, `add` only for files that don't exist yet. Never
  `add` a path that already exists; to edit/append to an existing file, use `modify`.
- **Apply tool (`ApplyPatchTool`):** an `add` to a file that already exists is no longer refused —
  it is applied as a **backed-up full-file overwrite** (result `action: add_overwrite`, with the
  pre-change `backup_path`). It stays inside the safety model: pre-apply backup, auto-apply
  verify+rollback, and the standalone-branch-never-main review gate all still apply, and the Patch
  Center shows the diff before any manual apply. New files still take the plain `add` path.

## v1.8.27 — Roadmap / documentation consolidation (NORTH_STAR)

Phase 1 of the master roadmap: stop roadmap drift by making one canonical direction document.

- New **`docs/NORTH_STAR.md`** — the single, ordered build order from the current baseline (v1.8.26)
  through the V2 Homelab Command Center and V3 bounded autonomous operator, plus the non-negotiable
  safety/architecture rules, the global bug-prevention gates, and the version-completion template.
- `docs/ROADMAP.md`, `docs/UI_ROADMAP.md`, and `docs/AUTONOMY.md` now carry a status block marking them
  as retained subsystem history and pointing to `NORTH_STAR.md`.
- README links `NORTH_STAR.md` from the version notes and adds a v1.8.27 changelog row.
- Docs only; no runtime behavior change.

## v1.8.26.1 — Harden auto-apply git for the systemd sandbox

Two fixes found while bringing the v1.8.26 loop up on a hardened LXC (`ProtectSystem=strict`):

- **Commit identity inline.** The service user (`anthill`) has no global git identity, so `git commit`
  failed with "Please tell me who you are." The commit now sets it inline —
  `git -c user.name="ANTHILL Auto-Apply" -c user.email="anthill@localhost" commit` — so it never
  depends on host git config.
- **Writable `known_hosts`.** `ssh` records the remote host key on first connect, but the service
  user's `~/.ssh` is read-only under `ProtectSystem=strict`. `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` now points
  `UserKnownHostsFile` at `/tmp/anthill_known_hosts` (writable via `PrivateTmp`, per-service), so the
  push succeeds without adding `.ssh` to `ReadWritePaths`.

Note: a non-`.anthill` auto-apply workspace still needs a systemd drop-in adding it to
`ReadWritePaths` (the sandbox mounts everything else read-only), and the workspace must be a clone
owned by the service user, checked out on the `<username>-anthill` branch.

## v1.8.26 — Auto-apply git integration (standalone branch, never main)

Expands the "Git-commit verified changes" toggle into a real, safety-gated git workflow for the
Director's auto-apply. After a green verify, ANTHILL commits the applied files to a standalone branch
and can push it for review — **without ever touching main**.

- New config: `autonomy_autoapply_git_username` (→ branch `<username>-anthill`),
  `autonomy_autoapply_git_remote` (default `origin`), `autonomy_autoapply_git_ssh_key_path`,
  `autonomy_autoapply_git_push`. Surfaced in **Security → Autonomous Auto-Apply** (username field shows
  the resulting branch; remote; SSH key path; "Push branch to origin" toggle).
- **SSH deploy key by reference:** the key is used via `GIT_SSH_COMMAND="ssh -i <path> …"`. Only the
  *path* is stored/shown; no key material is ever read into config, DB, UI, logs, or events.
- **Flow (per kept auto-apply):** verify the workspace is on `<username>-anthill` (create/checkout is
  a one-time operator step) → `git add`/`commit` the applied files → if push is on, `git fetch` +
  merge `origin/main` **into** the branch (one-way sync) → `git push <remote> <branch>` via the key.
- **Hard main-safety:** refuses to commit if the workspace is on `main`/`master`; only ever commits
  and pushes the standalone branch; never merges the branch into main; never force-pushes;
  fail-closed (a git error keeps the change on disk and logs `autonomy_autoapply_git_failed`).
- Open PRs from the pushed branch on GitHub; filing PRs/issues from ANTHILL needs the GitHub API
  (a token) and is a separate follow-up, out of scope for an SSH deploy key.

**Operator setup (one-time, on the host clone):** create the deploy key, add its public half to the
repo (Settings → Deploy keys, allow write), then `cd <workspace> && git checkout -b <username>-anthill
origin/main`. Point the SSH key path setting at the private key.

## v1.8.25.4 — Auto-Apply Security toggles never saved

The two Autonomous Auto-Apply toggles — "Enable auto-apply" (`autonomy_autoapply_enabled`) and
"Git-commit verified changes" (`autonomy_autoapply_git_commit`) — render in their own containers
(`#sec-autoapply-toggle`, `#sec-autoapply-git`), but `saveSecurity()` only harvested toggle state
from `#sec-toggles` and `#sec-shell-toggle`. So both toggles flipped visually and then silently
dropped out of the save payload. Added their containers to the collector; both persist now.

## v1.8.25.3 — Approved patches were un-appliable

Found during live V&V of the Patch Center. Approving a patch flipped only the *approval record* to
`approved` — nothing ever set the patch itself to `PatchStatus.Approved`. The Patch Center gates its
Apply action on the patch status being `approved`, so **Apply never appeared after approval** and
approved patches could not be applied through the UI (true for both the normal flow and the operator
approve-by-patch-id path).

- `ApproveRequest` now flips the patch to `approved` for a `patch_proposal` approval, mirroring the
  reject path (which already set the patch to `rejected`).
- The Patch Center's `canApply` also honors `approval_status === 'approved'`, so patches approved
  before this fix (approval approved but patch still `proposed`) are appliable too.

Apply still respects the write gates (`patch_application_enabled` / `file_writing_enabled`).

## v1.8.25.2 — CI guard against UI glyph corruption

The console UI has been re-saved as non-UTF-8 several times, flattening icon glyphs to `?` and other
glyphs to the U+FFFD replacement char (`�`). Adds a **`ui-integrity` CI job** that fails the build on
any `�`, bare `>?<` icon, `>? Label` button, or `'?':'?'` caret in `index.html` (the legitimate
`<kbd>?</kbd>` help key is allowlisted), plus a `node --check` of the embedded JavaScript — so this
recurring corruption can never merge again. CI-only; no runtime change.

## v1.8.25.1 — Console glyph-corruption repair

A follow-on to the v1.8.23.1 encoding repair, which only caught labeled buttons (`>? Label`) and
U+FFFD (`�`) characters. This pass fixes the icon-only glyphs that were also flattened to `?` and had
survived into the mainline:

- 19 `>?<` markup icons restored from the last clean revision: collapse buttons and expand carets
  (`▾`), mission-dispatch buttons (`▶`), the results-close button (`✕`), the full-event-log button
  (`⛶`), and the pheromone-table success/failure headers (`✓` / `✕`).
- 4 JS-literal expand/collapse carets (`det.open?'?':'?'` / `hidden?'?':'?'`) → `▾` / `▸`.
- The apply-warning prefix (`⚠`) and the nav "autonomy running" badge (`●`).
- The legitimate `?` help-shortcut key (`<kbd>?</kbd>`, from the v1.8.25 Command Center) is preserved.

No behavior change; embedded UI JavaScript still parses cleanly.

## v1.8.25 — UI Phase 10: Full Command Center Polish

Finishes the UI roadmap (all 10 phases now shipped). Everything is additive vanilla JS/CSS inside
the embedded console; no backend changes.

- **Command palette (Ctrl+K):** fuzzy-matched pages and actions (new mission, toggle nav, pending
  approvals, shortcuts, tour), recents boosted, arrow-key navigation. Ctrl+K previously jumped to
  the mission input — "New mission" is now the top palette action, one Enter away.
- **Global search:** typing 2+ characters in the palette also searches mission memory
  (`/memory/explorer`) — missions, tasks, patches, and sources deep-link to Results / Patch Center.
- **Notification center:** a header bell collects notable colony activity (mission complete/failed,
  patch applied/verified/failed, approvals, auto-apply outcomes) from the existing event feed, with
  an unread badge and per-item deep links. No new polling.
- **Keyboard shortcuts:** `g` then a letter jumps between pages (g o / g c / g m / g r / g e, plus
  admin g p / g b / g s / g u / g a), `?` opens a shortcuts reference, Esc closes overlays.
- **Saved layouts:** the console reopens on the page you left, alongside the existing persisted nav
  collapse, card collapse, and Patch Center grouping state.
- **Onboarding tour:** a five-step first-login walkthrough (dispatch → patch review → memory →
  shortcuts); skippable, never auto-shows again, restartable from the palette.
- Reduced-motion aware; role-gated (coordinators see no admin pages in palette, search, or g-nav).

## v1.8.24 — UI Phase 7: Visual Patch Center 2.0

Finishes UI Roadmap Phase 7 — grouping — and closes the operator gaps around pending patches.

**Grouping**
- New "Group by" control (status / risk / file / mission / objective); choice persists.
- Collapsible group sections with patch counts and per-status mini-chips; status/risk groups sort
  logically, the rest by size. Pure client-side re-render — filters, diffs, and actions unchanged.

**Operator approval for orphaned pending patches**
- Some pending patches had no approval record (deduped duplicates, pre-v1.8.16 history), so they
  were visible but impossible to act on. New `POST /patches/{id}/approve` and
  `POST /patches/{id}/reject` create the missing approval record first, then run the exact same
  Queen approve/reject transition — never a direct status write. Approve/Reject buttons now appear
  for these patches in the Patch Center.

**Operator-edited alternative patches**
- "✎ Edit as alternative" opens the proposal's content in an editor; submitting creates a NEW
  proposal (same file, same base content) behind the standard approval gate via
  `POST /patches/{id}/alternative`. Nothing is written to disk by editing. The original is marked
  superseded (optional) and its pending approval resolved.

**Unbiased verification with auto-approve**
- "⚖ Verify & Auto-approve" (`POST /patches/{id}/verify`): the patch is applied with a backup, the
  verify command runs (`autonomy_autoapply_verify_cmd` or built-in `dotnet build && dotnet test`),
  and the workspace is ALWAYS restored — green or red. The toolchain judges the change, not the
  ant that proposed it. Green ⇒ the patch is auto-APPROVED through the normal Queen/approval path;
  applying to disk still requires the operator. Red ⇒ stays pending with the failure tail recorded.
  Requires the same write gates as Apply (the temporary staging honors them).
- Tests: `PatchOperatorActionTests` covers orphan approve/reject, alternative creation/supersede,
  and edge cases against a real SQLite database.

## v1.8.23.3 — CI linux-x64 artifact packaging

Roadmap item "CI release packaging foundation": every successful CI run now produces a
release-ready, downloadable package — not just tagged releases.

- `publish-and-selftest` job now packages `./publish/linux-x64` (binary + `config.example.json`,
  README, CHANGELOG) as `anthill-linux-x64-v<version>.tar.gz` and uploads it as a CI artifact.
- Artifact name is read from `AnthillRuntime.Version` at build time, so it always matches the code.
- Packaging steps run strictly after publish + `--selftest` succeed; a broken build can never
  produce a downloadable package (`if-no-files-found: error` guards the upload).
- No runtime behavior changes; existing build/test/selftest/Docker/shellcheck jobs untouched.
- Documented where CI artifacts appear in `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` §4.

## v1.8.23 - Phase 9: Memory + Pheromone Explorer

- Adds a Memory + Pheromone Explorer on the existing Pheromones page.
- Visualizes success/failure/loop-pattern signals from mission history and pheromone trails.
- Adds mission memory search across missions, tasks, patches, and source summaries using existing read endpoints.
- Keeps prune controls on the same surface so weak/failure-dominant trails can be cleaned up without leaving the explorer.
- Delivered through issue #22, branch `feat/22-memory-pheromone-explorer`, and pull request workflow.

repair = **v1.8.25.1**, and so on.

## v1.8.23.2 — Patch Center duplicate-route fix

**Root cause of the recurring Patch Center empty HTTP 500.** `GET /patches` was registered twice: a
legacy `ProtectedText("/patches")` (the old `Queen.FormatPatchList()` text list) collided with the
structured `app.MapGet("/patches")` that the Patch Center UI uses. Two endpoints with an identical
method+template make ASP.NET throw `AmbiguousMatchException` during routing — *before* any handler or
middleware runs — so it surfaced as an uncatchable empty-body 500 that neither the v1.8.18.1 UTF-16
sanitizer nor the v1.8.23.1 serialization guard could touch (they run after routing).

- Removed the duplicate legacy `ProtectedText("/patches")` registration; the structured list remains.
- Added `AssertNoDuplicateRoutes()` at startup: enumerates every registered endpoint and throws a
  clear error at boot if any method+template is registered more than once, so this class of bug fails
  loudly at startup instead of silently 500ing at request time.

## v1.8.23.1 — Console UTF-8 repair + API serialization hardening

Two fixes bundled on top of Phase 9.

**Console encoding repair.** The v1.8.23 save round-tripped `index.html` through a non-UTF-8 encoding,
flattening 28 button icon glyphs (`↺`, `✂`, `▶`, `⌕`, `✓`, `✕`, `◈`) to `?` and leaving 354 U+FFFD
replacement characters (`�`) where em-dashes, ellipses, middot separators, and password-field bullets
used to be. All glyphs are restored; the file is clean UTF-8 again and the embedded JS still parses.

**Permanent Patch Center fix (empty HTTP 500).** `ApiJson.Ok`/`Error` previously handed the object
graph to `Results.Json`, which serializes during result execution — *after* the endpoint's own
try/catch has returned — so any serialization failure surfaced as an uncatchable empty-body 500 (the
`/patches` list was failing this way again). Responses are now serialized up front inside a guarded
`Envelope` helper (returning `Results.Content`), non-finite numbers are neutralized in the sanitizer,
and an outermost middleware converts any remaining unhandled exception into a valid JSON 500. No
endpoint can emit a silent empty 500 anymore — a failure now returns the real error message.

## v1.8.22.1 — ASCII banner tweak

Trim the boot/shell ANTHILL banner to the single large ant: removed the row of small ant figures
and the empty gap beneath the art so the banner butts directly against the following output line.

## v1.8.22 — Phase 8 + Ant Capability Profiles & Worker Runtime

Phase 8 UI (Ant Inspector + Performance Observatory) and the ASCII banner ship alongside the
capability layer incorporated from the codex branch:

- **Ant Capability Profiles** (`Agents/AntRegistry.cs`): 17 role definitions (6 executable —
  researcher, web, file, coder, builder, verifier) each with an `AntPermissionContract`
  (read/write workspace, read/write memory, web, shell, allowlisted checks, propose/apply patches)
  and named sub-workers. Forbidden paths (`py.old/`, `.git/`, `data/`, `.venv/`) and no-apply task
  types are enforced. `ValidateTask` gates each task against the mission constraints.
- **Worker Runtime** (`Agents/AntRuntime.cs`): resolves the role+worker for a task, injects worker
  context into the task snapshot, and emits audit warnings + metadata.
- Planner assigns a default worker per task and drops capability-rejected tasks; the Queen validates
  and resolves each task at run time (permission-denied tasks fail with a clear reason).
- Persistence: `tasks.assigned_worker` column (+ schema auto-migration), worker carried through
  task DeepCopy, graph nodes, and scheduler views; `SummarizeWorkerTelemetry()` aggregates worker
  performance.
- API: `GET /colony/registry` (roles + validation + telemetry) and `GET /colony/workers/telemetry`;
  `/missions/plan` now returns each step's `worker`/`display`, a `selected_path`, and
  `constraint_warnings`.
- UI: caste inspector shows a worker sub-caste breakdown, the DAG task drawer shows the resolved
  worker, and the plan preview shows the worker per step plus capability notes.

## v1.8.21 — Fix: autonomous auto-apply changes not persisting

Auto-apply is *apply → verify → keep-or-rollback*: a patch is kept only if verify exits 0, else every
applied patch is reverted. On a deployment with no build toolchain (a published-binary LXC, no dotnet
SDK, or `agent_workspace_dir` that isn't a buildable checkout), the built-in
`dotnet build && dotnet test` verify always failed — so auto-applied changes were silently rolled
back and never persisted ("not saving").

- **New opt-in gate `autonomy_autoapply_keep_without_verify`** (default false = keep verifying, safe).
  When true **and** no `autonomy_autoapply_verify_cmd` is configured, auto-apply keeps the applied
  patches instead of running (and failing) the built-in verify. If a verify command *is* set, it
  always runs and gates keep/rollback as before.
- **Clearer outcome logging.** The `autonomy_autoapply_started` / `_reverted` events now record the
  workspace path and the verify command; the reverted event's message spells out the fix options.
  A new `autonomy_autoapply_kept_unverified` event marks the keep-without-verify path, and
  `autonomy_autoapply_git_failed` surfaces a failed local git commit (kept on disk regardless).
- **Mission report surfacing.** `/missions/{id}/report` now includes an `auto_apply` outcome
  (kept / kept-unverified / reverted / apply-failed / git-failed / skipped) and the console shows an
  "Autonomous auto-apply" section — so "did the change actually stick?" is answerable at a glance.
  Auto-apply failures are also added to the report's Problems list.

Config default stays fail-safe: auto-apply is still OFF unless enabled with a path allowlist, and it
still verifies unless the operator explicitly opts out.



## v1.8.20 — Objective Command Board + Mission Timeline & Task DAG (UI Phases 5–6)

Two additive UI views over existing endpoints — no backend/API changes.

**Phase 5 — Objective Command Board** (new admin **Objectives** page). Every autonomous objective
laid out in seven lifecycle lanes — Backlog, Active, Paused, Completed, Stopped, Looping, Failed —
derived from `/objectives` status + `end_reason`/`retired_code`. Each card shows title, runs, success
EMA, priority, and end reason; expanding a card loads `/objectives/{id}/detail` (runs, missions,
tasks, patch rollup) with deep links to Results and the Patch Center. Admin-gated.

**Phase 6 — Mission Timeline + Task DAG viewer** (in the mission report / Results). A lazy-loaded
"Task Flow" section renders the mission's task graph two ways from `/missions/{id}/graph`:

- **DAG** — layered by dependency depth, nodes colored by status and ant, dependency edges drawn with
  **failure paths highlighted in red**.
- **Timeline** — tasks ordered by start time with duration bars.

Clicking a node/row opens a task detail drawer (ant, type, status, elapsed, attempts, failure
reason). Final output stays separated in its own report section as before. Rendered on demand so the
report stays light.


## v1.8.19 — Colony Live Canvas 2.0 (UI Phase 4)

Additive upgrade to the existing Colony canvas — the working node graph, task-dependency edges
(`dataFlowEdges`), handoff animation, pan/zoom, and node inspector are all preserved. New:

- **Caste legend + pheromone HUD overlay** on the canvas: the six ant castes with live-activity dots,
  and a "Colony Learning · Pheromones" panel showing the top real pheromone trails (`/pheromones/json`)
  with strength bars. Polls only while the Colony page is visible; glass overlay, `pointer-events:none`.
- **Real pheromone drift** on the canvas: motes drift from the castes toward the Queen with density and
  opacity scaled by actual colony trail strength (a global `pheromoneIntensity`). One additive CSS-cheap
  draw pass, guarded so it's invisible until the colony has learned something; reduced-motion aware.
- **Corrected node inspector**: the previously mislabeled "Pheromone Trail" bar (which just showed
  activity %) is now a **Live Task Load** breakdown — running / completed / failed tasks for that caste
  from the current mission graph. Real data.

No backend or API changes; reuses `/pheromones/json` and the existing `/graph` feed. The render loop
gains a single guarded pass; existing colony interaction and behavior are unchanged.



## v1.8.18.1 — Fix: Patch Center empty HTTP 500 (invalid UTF-16 in JSON)

Live testing surfaced `GET /patches` returning an empty HTTP 500 ("Error loading patches: Empty
response (HTTP 500)"). Root cause: `ApiJson.Ok` returns `Results.Json`, which serializes the payload
during response execution — **after** the endpoint's own try/catch has returned — so the failure was
uncatchable and produced an empty 500. `System.Text.Json` throws *"Cannot transcode invalid UTF-16"*
on a string containing a lone/unpaired surrogate, which LLM-generated patch `reason` / `summary` /
`mission_goal` text occasionally contains (clean test data never did).

Fix — scrub invalid UTF-16 at the JSON boundary so no endpoint can 500 on it:

- `TextUtil.SanitizeUtf16` replaces lone surrogates with U+FFFD (fast path: strings without
  surrogates are returned unchanged, no allocation).
- `ApiJson.Ok` / `Error` now recursively sanitize every string reachable from the payload
  (`ApiJson.SanitizeJson` walks dictionaries and lists; `byte[]` and scalars pass through so base64 /
  number serialization is preserved). This makes **all** JSON endpoints fail-safe against bad
  Unicode, not just the Patch Center.
- Tests (`JsonSafetyTests`) cover lone high/low surrogates, valid emoji preservation, deep nested
  scrubbing that then serializes cleanly, and `byte[]`/scalar passthrough.



## v1.8.18 — Mission Composer + Plan Preview (UI Phase 3)

Lets an operator review the generated task plan — and see how a mode/constraint reshapes it — before
a mission runs. Additive; existing one-shot dispatch is unchanged.

**Backend — dry-run planner.** New `POST /missions/plan` (permission `run_mission`, rate-limited)
runs the real planner + v1.8.16 constraint enforcement for a goal and returns the task list
**without creating, persisting, executing, or logging a mission** (`Queen.PlanPreview`). The response
includes each step's title, assigned ant, task type, and dependency edges (as human step numbers),
plus the parsed constraint flags (`verification_only` / `read_only` / `no_patches` / `one_shot` /
`blocks_patches`) and whether the plan contains a coder patch step. No fake capability — the preview
is exactly what a dispatch would plan.

**UI — Mission Composer.** The Overview mission node gains a **Preview Plan** action. It composes the
goal (raw directive + any selected mode's safe wording), calls `/missions/plan`, and renders the plan:
a constraint banner (e.g. "verification-only — no file changes"), the ordered steps with per-ant
badges, task types, and "after step N" dependencies, then **Approve & Dispatch** / **Edit** / **Reject**.
Approve submits the exact previewed goal via the existing `/missions` path; the raw ▶ / Enter dispatch
still works unchanged for one-shot use. Direct dispatch and Approve share one `submitMissionGoal()`
so the goal string is identical either way.

**Tests.** `PlanPreviewTests` (Ollama forced off → deterministic fallback planner) assert the preview
drops coder steps for verification-only goals, keeps them for code goals, always ends with a verifier,
and creates no mission row.



## v1.8.17 — Colony Command Center HUD Upgrade (Phases 1–2)

Turns the Overview into a live swarm command-center HUD, built additively on the existing
single-file console — no new dependencies, all animations CSS-only and reduced-motion aware.

**Phase 1 — HUD design system.** Reusable vanilla primitives + CSS: a canonical `hud-badge`
(running/idle/active/paused/completed/stopped/looping/failed/pending/approved/applied/rejected/
warning/unknown), `hud-risk` (low/medium/high/unknown), glass `hud-panel` with corner brackets and
optional active/warn/alert glow, `hud-metric` cards, `hud-telem` lines, loading/empty/error state
blocks, and a `hud-act` action-button group. JS helpers `hudBadge()`, `hudRisk()`, `hudStatusClass()`.

**Phase 2 — Overview command dashboard.** All panels use real API data with graceful `—`/empty/error
fallbacks (no fabricated values):

- **Colony status strip** — API link, provider/model, autonomy state, active missions, active
  objectives, pending approvals, warnings, and governor resource pressure; each deep-links to the
  relevant page and highlights warn/alert states.
- **Central system core** — a J.A.R.V.I.S.-style orb whose state (IDLE / MISSION ACTIVE / AUTONOMY
  ONLINE / OPERATOR ACTION / ALERT) is derived from real counts (active jobs, autonomy, pending/high-
  risk patches, failed missions, retired objectives, provider health). CSS rings/pulse only.
- **Operator attention** — real action items (pending/high-risk patches, failed missions, retired/
  failed objectives, backend-unreachable) with severity, reason, and deep link; "No operator action
  required" when clear.
- **Hardware/environment cards** — CPU load/core, memory-available %, backend latency, and effective/
  configured concurrency from the ResourceGovernor signals (`/autonomy/status`); shown as `—` with a
  "runs during autonomy" note when the governor hasn't sampled yet. Percentages clamped 0–100.
- **Mission command node** — terminal-style `ANTHILL_CORE >` input (existing submission preserved)
  with Inspect / Verify / Patch Proposal / Full Build-Test mode buttons that prepend visible, safe
  wording read by the v1.8.16 planner constraints (verification-only / no-patch). Selected mode is
  shown as a badge; nothing is changed silently.
- **Summaries** — recent missions, patch-status rollup (+high-risk), and objective-status rollup,
  each linking to Results / Patch Center / Autonomy. Live telemetry + recent jobs reuse the existing
  event/job feeds.

Data polling reuses the existing gated cadence (only fetches while Overview is visible); no new
uncleaned timers. Existing pages, navigation, mission submission, autonomy, and approval/apply
behavior are unchanged. UI-only — no API or backend changes.



## v1.8.16.1 — Patch Center robustness + validation

Stabilization pass on the v1.8.16 Patch Center after live testing surfaced an opaque
"Unexpected end of JSON input" error in the console:

- **`api()` never throws on an empty/non-JSON body.** The shared client helper now reads the body as
  text and returns a structured `{success:false, message}` instead of letting `Response.json()`
  throw a raw parse error. A 404 (e.g. a stale server missing a newly added endpoint) now reports a
  clear "Empty response (HTTP 404) — this build may be missing the endpoint; redeploy?" message.
- **`GET /patches` and `/patches/{id}/detail` are wrapped in try/catch**, returning a JSON error
  payload instead of a bare 500 if anything unexpected happens while assembling the list/detail.
- **Fixed one-shot phrase detection** so "run this once" / "do this once" are recognized (also adds
  "just once" / "only once").
- **New DB-backed tests** (`PatchCenterTests`) exercise `ListPatchesForCenter`, the per-mission and
  per-objective patch rollups, and `ListEndedObjectives` against a real SQLite database, so a query
  dialect/column error is caught in CI rather than as a runtime 500.



## v1.8.16 — Objective Lifecycle Hardening + Visual Patch Review Center

Two focused improvements to how the colony ends autonomous work and how the operator reviews the
changes it proposes. See `docs/ROADMAP.md` for the 10-phase direction; Phases 1–2 ship here.

**Objective lifecycle (Phase 1).** One-shot and verification-only objectives now end cleanly instead
of regenerating near-identical missions until loop detection retires them:

- New clean-completion path (`ObjectiveLifecycle.EvaluateCompletion`) runs *before* loop detection.
  A successful one-shot objective ends `completed_successfully`; a successful verification-only /
  read-only / no-patch objective that discovered no new work ends `stopped_no_followup_required`.
  Broad standing objectives (no one-shot/verify wording, `max_runs` 0/>1) keep running as before.
- Loop detection is preserved strictly for true repeated loops — it is no longer the normal ending
  path for successful maintenance work.
- Unified end reasons stamped on every ended objective: `completed_successfully`,
  `stopped_no_followup_required`, `retired_looping`, `failed`, `manually_paused`, `manually_stopped`.
- New config `autonomy_oneshot_completion` (default on) gates the behaviour.

**Planner constraint enforcement (Phase 1).** The planner now reads explicit mission constraints
(`MissionConstraints`): a `verification-only` / `read-only` / `do not modify files` mission gets a
hard prompt directive *and* a deterministic post-plan strip of every coder patch-proposal task, with
a read-only file-inspection task substituted so verification missions still actually inspect files.
Normal code-change missions keep the full coder/builder/verifier workflow.

**Visual Patch Center (Phase 2).** A new admin page lists every patch proposal with status and risk
badges, filterable by status, risk, mission, objective, and file path. Each patch expands to a
unified diff (removed/added/context) and offers Approve / Reject / Apply / View Mission — reusing the
existing approve-then-apply safety model, with an Apply confirmation that surfaces operator safety
checks (risk level, missing old content, no pre-apply backup). Patch links are wired into mission
Results (per-mission counts + deep link), the Autonomy runs table (a patch summary per run), and the
Completed Objectives detail (patch activity per objective). Additive API only: `GET /patches`,
`GET /patches/{id}/detail`, plus patch rollups on the report/runs/objective endpoints. Storage is
unchanged; new `PatchStatus.Superseded` completes the status model. No Python touched.



## v1.8.15.7 — System Health panel on the Overview

Added an enterprise-style **System Health** card to the Overview, giving an at-a-glance read on the
three things that actually go wrong in a long-running colony, each with a green/amber/red status dot:

- **Autonomy** — RUNNING / IDLE / HALTED / OFF state, missions-today vs the daily cap, live backlog
  (pending + active objectives), and effective/configured concurrency. Sourced from `/autonomy/status`.
- **Storage** — free disk with a usage bar that turns amber at 85% and red at 93%, plus the SQLite DB
  size and backup count/size. Sourced from `/maintenance/stats`. When disk is tight *and* backups are
  prunable, an alert line points straight to **Settings → Maintenance → Flush Cache** to reclaim it.
- **Coder Patches** — recent parse success rate (`patch_set_created` vs `patch_proposal_parse_failed`)
  with applied count, so the v1.8.15.6 parse-hardening win stays visible. Sourced from `/events/json`.

The panel polls every 8s but only fetches while the Overview is the visible page (and refreshes
immediately on navigation to it), so it adds no load elsewhere. UI-only change — no API surface added.

## v1.8.15.6 — Coder patches actually parse now (fewer patch_proposal_parse_failed)

Live diagnostics showed a steady stream of `patch_proposal_parse_failed` — coder output that never
reached the approval queue or auto-apply. Root causes and fixes:

- **Raw control chars in JSON (the big one).** Small local models emit patches with a literal
  newline inside string values (`"new_content": "line1<newline>line2"`), which strict JSON rejects
  with `'0x0A' is invalid within a JSON string`. `Json.ExtractJsonObject` now retries every parse on
  a copy where control chars inside string literals are escaped, and tolerates trailing commas and
  comments. This recovers the most common failure class.
- **Placeholder file paths.** The v1.8.13 neutral example (`file.ext`) was being copied literally,
  producing `file_path: .ext` — rejected as an unsupported type. The coder prompt now uses an
  obvious `<...>` placeholder with real examples, forbids placeholder paths outright, and tells the
  model to escape newlines as `\n` (single-line JSON).
- **One bad proposal no longer discards the set.** `PatchProposalParser` parses each proposal in its
  own try/catch — a malformed entry (bad path, missing reason) is skipped and the valid proposals in
  the same set survive, instead of the whole patch set being thrown away.
- Tests: `JsonRepairTests` (raw newline/tab/CR recovery, trailing commas, code fences, prose
  stripping, valid-escape round-trip, control-chars-outside-strings untouched).

## v1.8.15.5 — Completed Objectives box for loop-retired objectives

Objectives the Director retires for looping (Phase 4 loop detection) previously stayed in the
paused backlog, mixed in with normal paused objectives. They now move to a dedicated
**Completed Objectives** box under Configuration → Autonomy.

- The Director stamps a retirement marker (`retired_code`, `retired_reason`, `retired_at`) onto
  the objective's metadata when it retires it — reusing the existing objective model, no schema
  change and no change to the loop-detection logic itself.
- The active/paused backlog table now filters out `retired_code == "looping_goals"`; normal
  paused objectives (circuit-breaker / stale) are unaffected.
- New **Completed Objectives** card: each loop-retired objective is one collapsed expandable row —
  title, a **Stopped** badge, a **Looping** badge, and the short stop reason. Expanding lazy-loads
  the compiled detail (objective ID, title, stop/loop reason, related runs, missions, tasks, and
  the stopped timestamp).
- New: `SqliteMemory.ListRetiredObjectives`, `ApiHost.CompletedObjectiveDetail`; endpoints
  `GET /objectives/completed` and `GET /objectives/{id}/detail` (both `read_objectives`); retirement
  markers added to the `/objectives` response.
- Tests: `ListRetiredObjectives_FindsLoopingRetired_ByMetadata` (looping-retired found; plain-paused
  and stale-retired excluded).

## v1.8.15.4 — Disk hygiene: backup retention + maintenance controls

Live diagnosis of a filling 51 GB disk found the cause: **1,032 pre-mission DB backups = 34 GB**.
ANTHILL copies the whole 68 MB database before every mission and never pruned the copies. Fixed at
the root, plus operator controls for cleanup.

- **Backup retention (the fix).** After each pre-mission backup the Queen now prunes the backup
  directory to the newest `max_db_backups` (default 10) via `FileSecurity.PruneBackups`. The backup
  dir is now bounded (~10 × DB size) instead of growing one full copy per mission forever. Existing
  bloat is reclaimed by the first Flush (or the next mission's auto-prune).
- **Flush Cache** (Settings → System Info → Maintenance): prunes old backups, deletes events older
  than `event_retention_days` (0 = keep all), and `VACUUM`s the database — reports the bytes freed.
  The panel shows disk free, DB size, and backup count/size.
- **Clear Missions** (Missions page): deletes all mission-execution history (missions, tasks,
  events, patches, approvals, sources, agent messages) and compacts — keeps objectives, pheromones,
  users, providers, config.
- **Cancel All** (Missions page): drops all queued jobs (a running mission finishes on its own,
  bounded by its timeout). Also adds `POST /jobs/{id}/cancel` and `POST /jobs/cancel-all`, with a
  `cancelled` job status the worker honors.
- **Dump Directives** (Autonomy page): clears the entire objective backlog + its run history.
- **Reset Config** (Maintenance): resets all tunable settings to safe defaults while **preserving
  connection settings** (Ollama host/model/routes, API bind, workspace) so a reset never strands the
  colony.
- New: `SqliteMemory.Maintenance` (FlushCache / ClearMissionHistory / ClearObjectives / TableCounts
  / DatabaseFileBytes), `FileSecurity.PruneBackups`/`BackupStats`, `AnthillRuntime.ResetConfig`,
  `ApiJobRegistry.Cancel`/`CancelAll`; endpoints `GET /maintenance/stats`, `POST /maintenance/{flush,
  clear-missions,reset-config}`, `POST /objectives/clear`. Config: `max_db_backups`,
  `event_retention_days`.
- Tests: `MaintenanceTests` (retention keeps newest N, reports freed, edge cases).

## v1.8.15.3 — Install polkit natively in the LXC setup

v1.8.15.2 shipped the scoped polkit rule but only installed it *if* polkit was already present —
on a fresh Debian LXC it isn't, so the installer skipped it ("polkit not present"). `setup.sh`
now **installs polkit itself** (like it installs the .NET SDK): `apt-get install polkitd` with
fallbacks to `polkit` / `policykit-1` across distros, enables the daemon, writes the scoped JS
rule (modern polkit, Debian 12+) *and* a `.pkla` fallback (legacy polkit 0.105, Ubuntu 22.04),
and restarts polkit. After a `git pull && bash deploy/lxc/setup.sh` the operator Shell's
Restart/Status/Logs buttons work with no extra steps. No application-code change — same binary,
version bumped for deploy traceability.

## v1.8.15.2 — Strategist intent fidelity, backlog-sprawl cap, operator-shell service control

The v1.8.15.1 live test proved the planner now routes file goals to the coder, but exposed that
the **Strategist drifts** — it rewrote a one-shot charter ("create docs/x.md") into an unrelated
goal ("train a model on docs") before the planner ever saw it — and that autonomous runs **spawn
follow-up objectives aggressively** (13 accumulated in a short test). Both fixed, plus the
operator-shell service-control item from the roadmap.

Autonomy — intent fidelity:

- **One-shot objectives are never reinterpreted.** An objective with `max_runs == 1` is an
  explicit do-this-once task; `Strategist.GenerateGoal` now uses its charter verbatim (bypassing
  the LLM entirely, `Source = "charter_verbatim"`) so the operator's intent reaches the planner
  unchanged. Standing objectives (`max_runs` 0/>1) still go through the Strategist.
- **The Strategist prompt now preserves the charter.** It must produce a goal that directly
  accomplishes the charter (execute it as written on the first run; only take the next incremental
  step once a prior run already accomplished it) — never substitute a different or broader task —
  and follow-ups should "almost always be empty" (add one only for a genuinely distinct new
  objective, never to seem productive).

Autonomy — sprawl guard:

- **`autonomy_max_backlog` (default 40).** The Strategist stops enqueuing self-generated follow-up
  objectives once the open backlog (pending + active) reaches the cap — a structural bound on
  sprawl regardless of model behavior, on top of the existing per-run rate and depth caps. 0 = no
  cap. Clamped, settings-whitelisted, in `config.example.json`.

Operator-shell service control:

- The systemd unit's `NoNewPrivileges=true` blocks `sudo`, so `setup.sh` now installs a **scoped
  polkit rule** (`deploy/lxc/anthill-polkit.rules.template` → `/etc/polkit-1/rules.d/49-anthill.rules`)
  that lets the admin-only operator Shell manage **only** the `anthill.service` unit
  (restart/stop/start/status) over D-Bus — no privilege escalation, hardening untouched. The Shell
  tab gains quick buttons: Service status, Recent logs, Restart service (with a confirm), Host
  health. Best-effort: skipped with a message if polkit isn't installed. Docs in DEPLOYMENT.md.
- Tests: `OneShotObjective_UsesCharterVerbatim_EvenWithNoRouter`.

## v1.8.15.1 — Fixes from the live Phase 5 test

A live test of Phase 5 on the LXC confirmed both the keep and rollback branches work end to end
(patch applied → verify → kept + approval consumed; and applied → verify failed → rolled back,
workspace clean). It also surfaced three issues, all fixed here:

- **`DELETE /objectives/{id}` returned 500 for any objective that had run.** `autonomy_runs` has a
  foreign key to `objectives(id)` with `foreign_keys=ON`, so deleting an objective with run history
  threw — meaning the Delete button in the backlog was broken for anything that had executed.
  `DeleteObjective` now cascades the dependent runs and detaches follow-up children in one
  transaction; the endpoint returns a clean error instead of a 500 on any other failure.
- **The planner rarely routed file-creation goals to the coder ant** — the root cause of "work
  happens but nothing lands." Two prompt bugs: `docs` was listed as a *web-search* trigger (so
  "create a file in docs/" went to web research), and nothing told the planner that creating or
  editing a file requires a coder patch. The planner prompt now states plainly that any goal which
  creates/adds/writes/edits/patches a file (including `.md`/config) **must** include a
  `patch_proposal` coder task, clarifies that proposing a patch is expected (not a "don't write
  files" violation), and stops treating a documentation path as a web trigger. The offline fallback
  planner now checks code/file keywords **before** the web branch and recognizes create/add/write/
  edit/`.md`/`.cs` goals.
- **Auto-apply on a read-only workspace failed one patch at a time with no explanation.** On a
  hardened LXC (`systemd ProtectSystem=strict`) the source tree is read-only to the service, so
  every apply failed individually. The runner now does a one-shot writability preflight and, if the
  workspace root can't be written, logs a single clear `autonomy_autoapply_skipped`
  (`reason: workspace_readonly`) pointing at `agent_workspace_dir` — instead of a stream of
  `apply_failed`. Docs add the writable-checkout deployment pattern for real self-modification.
- Tests: `DeleteObjective_CascadesRunsAndDetachesChildren`.

## v1.8.15 — Phase 5 autonomy: gated auto-apply (the autonomy roadmap is complete)

The Director can now **ship low-risk fixes on its own** instead of queueing every patch for a
human forever — the direct answer to the approval pile-up. It's the highest-risk capability in the
system (autonomous writes to disk), so it's fail-closed and multiply gated, and the entire safety
model is *apply → verify → keep-or-rollback*.

- **Strict eligibility gate** (`Autonomy/AutoApplyPolicy.cs`): a patch is auto-appliable only when
  every condition holds — the master switch is on; the change is `add`/`modify` (never
  delete/rename); the file path matches an operator glob in `autonomy_autoapply_paths` (an **empty
  allowlist means nothing is eligible**, so it's inert until you widen it); and the change is
  within `autonomy_autoapply_max_lines`. Glob supports `**`/`*`/`?`.
- **Apply → verify → rollback** (`Anthill.Api/AutoApplyRunner.cs`, runs on the Director thread
  after a *successful* mission): applies eligible patches with per-file backups, then runs
  `dotnet build && dotnet test` (or your `autonomy_autoapply_verify_cmd`) in the workspace,
  timeout-bounded. **Green** ⇒ changes stay, the matching approval requests are marked `consumed`
  (they leave the queue), optional local `git` commit (never pushed). **Red/timeout** ⇒ every
  applied patch is rolled back (modify → restore backup, add → delete) and marked failed.
- **Depends on the write gates** (`patch_application_enabled` + `file_writing_enabled`); logs
  `autonomy_autoapply_skipped` and does nothing if they're off. **Forced off in every safety
  profile** and off by default.
- **Full audit trail**: `autonomy_autoapply_started`/`_applied`/`_verified`/`_reverted`/
  `_rolled_back`/`_ineligible`/`_skipped` events; applied/reverted patches appear in the mission
  report's tangible-changes with their final status.
- **Config** (clamped, settings-whitelisted, editable in **Configuration → Security → Autonomous
  Auto-Apply**): `autonomy_autoapply_enabled`, `autonomy_autoapply_paths`,
  `autonomy_autoapply_max_lines`, `autonomy_autoapply_verify_cmd`,
  `autonomy_autoapply_verify_timeout`, `autonomy_autoapply_git_commit`.
- New `Queen.ApplyPatchForAutomation` / `RollbackAutoApplied` (structured apply with backup path
  for rollback). `/autonomy/status` gains `autoapply_enabled` / `autoapply_paths`.
- Tests: `AutoApplyPolicyTests` — eligibility matrix, glob semantics, size cap, change-type,
  disabled and empty-allowlist denial. (`InternalsVisibleTo("Anthill.Tests")` added to
  Anthill.Core so the suite can exercise the internal `GlobMatches` helper — same pattern as
  Anthill.Api.)

Also fixed: **`UpdateChecker.Compare` didn't tolerate a leading `v`** — `Compare("v1.8.15", …)`
parsed the `v1` segment as `0`, so the version read as older (a CI test caught it; production was
unaffected because `Fetch()` stripped the `v` before calling `Compare`). `Compare` now strips a
leading `v`/`V` on both sides itself.

With Phase 5 in, **the autonomy roadmap (Phases 0–5) is complete.**

## v1.8.14.5 — Auto-publish releases + hardening pass (audit)

Wraps the release-automation change with a thorough audit of everything shipped in the 1.8.14.x
line — resource leaks, security boundaries, and correctness. All findings fixed.

Release automation:

- The release workflow now **publishes** the GitHub Release and pushes the GHCR container package
  automatically on every tag push (was: created as a draft for manual publishing). `make_latest`,
  and four-part maintenance tags (`vX.Y.Z.W`) matched explicitly. README/DEPLOYMENT.md updated.

Security:

- **Fixed a privilege leak in the mission report.** `GET /missions/{id}/report` is served under
  `read_status` (which Mission Coordinators hold) but surfaced patch proposals, approval state,
  and autonomy objectives — all admin-only reads (`read_patches`/`read_approvals`/`read_objectives`
  are never in the coordinator set). The report now includes those sections only for callers who
  could read them directly (`CallerHas`), so it can't be used as a side channel around the
  permission model. Non-admins still get goal, status, final output, per-task results, and
  problems (all things they can already read).
- **Bounded two unbounded `?limit` query params** (`/events/json`, `/pheromones/json`) — a huge
  value could sweep the entire log/trail table in one request; now clamped.

Resource leaks:

- **Removed two per-request `new HttpClient` allocations** (`/system/summary`'s Ollama probe and
  the `/ollama/models` proxy). Under the header's periodic polling these leaked sockets over time;
  both now share one static client with per-call `CancellationToken` timeouts.
- **Session registry no longer grows unbounded**: abandoned session tokens (user logs in, never
  returns) were only evicted when that exact token was next resolved. Login now opportunistically
  prunes expired sessions.

Correctness:

- **Operator shell could truncate output.** `Process.WaitForExit(timeout)` can return before the
  async stdout/stderr handlers finish draining; the executor now calls the parameterless
  `WaitForExit()` afterward to guarantee a full flush, and locks the output builders against the
  threadpool callbacks that append to them.
- Tests: `PermissionBoundaryTests` (admin-only vs coordinator permission matrix).

## v1.8.14.4 — Live header status: update check, model/provider popover, local-vs-cloud icon

The top-right header was static — a fixed model string and an "Online" badge that didn't say what
was online. It's now a live, clickable status chip.

- **Update check** (`GET /update/check`): compares the running version against the latest release
  tag on the public GitHub repo and flags when a newer one exists. Result is cached server-side
  (30 min) so the header poll never hammers GitHub, and every failure (offline, rate-limited, no
  releases) degrades to "unknown" rather than erroring. When an update is available the chip shows
  a pulsing dot and the popover gives the new version, a release-notes link, and the exact LXC
  upgrade command. A "Re-check" button forces a fresh look (`?force=1`).
- **Local vs Providers icon**: the chip carries a monitor icon (green **LOCAL**) when every model
  role runs on local Ollama, or a cloud icon (purple **PROVIDERS** / **MIXED**) when any role is
  routed to OpenAI/Anthropic/Perplexity/OpenRouter — so the colony's cost/privacy posture is
  visible at a glance.
- **What's actually online**: the chip's dot now reflects backend health, not just the API — it
  goes red if Ollama is unreachable even while the API answers. The popover breaks it down: API
  server, Ollama backend reachability (with a live 3s probe), and Ollama host.
- **Model visibility + quick actions** (`GET /system/summary`): the popover lists every role's
  provider + model (each tagged local/cloud), the default model, and how many providers are
  connected, with one-click buttons to Ant Config (change models) and Settings → Providers.
- New: `src/Anthill.Api/UpdateChecker.cs`; `GET /update/check` + `GET /system/summary`.
- Tests: `UpdateCheckerTests` (dotted four-part version ordering, leading-v tolerance).

Release automation:

- The release workflow now **publishes** the GitHub Release and the GHCR container package
  automatically on every tag push (was: created as a draft for manual publishing). Each
  `git push origin vX.Y.Z[.W]` builds the self-contained linux-x64/win-x64 archives, pushes
  `ghcr.io/<repo>:<version>` + `:latest`, and publishes the Release (marked "latest") with the
  matching CHANGELOG section as notes. Four-part maintenance tags (`vX.Y.Z.W`) are matched
  explicitly. Docs (README, DEPLOYMENT.md) updated to match.

## v1.8.14.3 — Configuration: Security tab + admin-only Shell console

> **Pre-commit checklist** — the docs must be true before every commit:
> 1. Bump the version in all markers: `Directory.Build.props`, `AnthillRuntime.Version`,
>    `src/Anthill.Api/Ui/index.html` (title + auth logo + nav badge), `src/Anthill.Api/Program.cs`,
>    `src/Anthill.Cli/Program.cs`, `build.sh`, `build.ps1`, and the README banner.
>    Verify with: `grep -rn "<old version>" --exclude-dir=.git --exclude-dir=obj --exclude-dir=bin .`
> 2. Add the CHANGELOG entry (this file) — it becomes the GitHub release notes.
> 3. **Update README.md sections touched by the change** (Colony UI Guide, API Reference,
>    Configuration Reference, deployment sections) and `config.example.json` for new knobs.
> 4. Update `docs/AUTONOMY.md` / `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` when behavior in their scope changes.
> 5. Sweep for leftovers: stale comments, dead config keys, outdated status claims, debug code.
> 6. `dotnet test Anthill.sln -c Release` green, then commit + tag + push.

## v1.8.14.3 — Configuration: Security tab + admin-only Shell console

Two new admin-only pages under Configuration.

- **Security tab**: a single place for the app's security posture — auth mode, safety profile,
  network bind exposure, and encryption-at-rest at a glance — plus live toggles for every
  capability gate (web search, file read/write, patch application, the AI ants' shell tool), the
  **workspace boundary** (`agent_workspace_dir`, the only path the file/coder ants may touch), and
  the operator-shell controls. All persist through the existing `/settings` path.
- **Shell tab**: a direct interactive terminal into the host ANTHILL runs on (the LXC/VM/box) —
  command input with history (↑/↓), streamed stdout/stderr, exit code, elapsed time, and a
  settable working directory. Built for host maintenance the AI ants must never do (restart the
  service, pull updates, edit config).

Because the Shell console is host remote-code-execution, it is gated four independent ways:
(1) authenticated, (2) **admin role only** — the new `operator_shell` permission is never in the
coordinator set, so a Mission Coordinator cannot see or use it; (3) the `operator_shell_enabled`
config gate (toggleable from the Security tab); and (4) **every command is written to the audit
event log** (`operator_shell_command` before it runs, `operator_shell_result` after) with the
operator's username, so there's a durable record of who ran what. Each command is bounded by a
60-second timeout and its output capped. Per operator request it ships **enabled for admins** by
default; set `operator_shell_enabled: false` (or toggle it off in Security) on any install you
don't fully trust on the network. Distinct from `shell_tool_enabled`, which gates the AI ants'
*allowlisted* tool and stays off by default.

- New: `GET /shell/info`, `POST /shell/exec` (both `operator_shell`, admin-only);
  `src/Anthill.Api/OperatorShell.cs`; config keys `operator_shell_enabled` / `operator_shell_dir`;
  `api_auth_enabled` + `agent_workspace_dir` added to the settings snapshot.
- Tests: `OperatorShellTests` — admin-only permission, command execution, non-zero exit,
  working-directory handling.

## v1.8.14.2 — Results page; stale-UI cache fix; approval-queue dedupe

New — **Results page** (operator request: mission results shouldn't take over the whole screen):

- A dedicated **Results** nav page lists every mission (newest first, filterable by
  completed / partial / failed) as compact collapsible rows — status in plain English, goal,
  score, and finish time. Expanding a row lazily loads the full Mission Report inline: final
  output, per-task readable results, tangible changes with approval states, problems, and — new —
  the **autonomous-run context** (which objective drove the mission) and the **objectives this
  mission created** (Strategist follow-ups, now stamped with `created_by_mission_id` /
  `created_by_run_id` metadata when the Director saves them, so the lineage is queryable).
- Every **View Result** button routes here and auto-expands that mission (jobs lists, Missions
  page, and the Autonomy runs table's View). Running jobs keep a compact "View Status" quick
  view; the old full-screen overlay remains only as a fallback for legacy jobs without a
  mission id.
- New API: `GET /missions/json?limit=` (mission history as JSON) and mission reports now include
  `autonomy_run` + `created_objectives`. New `SqliteMemory.GetAutonomyRunForMission` /
  `ListObjectivesCreatedByMission`.

Verified live against the running LXC instance (v1.8.14.1) before shipping: the backend live
task feed and the new canvas logic were confirmed working in a fresh browser session — particles
flowing, per-ant activity tracking real task states, correct idle when nothing runs. The
"still broken" console was the *browser's cached copy of the previous UI*.

- **`/ui` is now served with `Cache-Control: no-store`.** The console is embedded in the binary,
  and without cache headers a browser can silently pin an operator to the previous version's
  UI after every upgrade (stale canvas logic, missing panels) until a manual hard-refresh. Now
  every page load fetches the UI the running binary actually ships. (One last hard-refresh is
  needed to pick this version up; after that, never again.)
- **Approval-queue flooding fixed with dedupe.** High-frequency autonomous testing (observed
  live: 62 missions/hour, 1000/day until the daily budget tripped) re-proposes the same change
  run after run while the first request sits unreviewed — every rerun stacked another identical
  approval request. `Queen.ProcessPatchProposals` now checks
  `SqliteMemory.HasDuplicatePendingApproval` (same file, change type, and old/new content,
  compared after decryption) and skips creating a duplicate, logging an
  `approval_request_deduped` event instead. Decided (approved/rejected) requests never block a
  fresh proposal. Reminder that stacking ≠ malfunction: the Director *never* auto-approves —
  clearing the queue is the operator's half of the workflow until gated auto-apply (Phase 5)
  lands.
- **Tests**: `ApprovalDedupeTests` — identical pending change detected; different content/file
  not deduped; decided approvals don't block; null-content comparisons.

## v1.8.14.1 — Mission Reports: see exactly what the colony did, in plain English

Operator feedback from live use: work was "seemingly being done" (autonomous runs completing,
follow-up objectives appearing) but nothing readable in the UI showed what actually happened or
changed. Two root causes: (1) the only result view was the raw CLI dump — final output, debug
trace, and task JSON in one wall of jargon; (2) the tangible outputs of missions (patch
proposals waiting in the approval queue) were never connected to the mission/run that produced
them. Note the design constraint that makes visibility essential: **the colony cannot change
files or its own UI by itself** — every file change is a patch proposal that waits for human
approval + apply. If nothing is approved, nothing changes; the console now says so explicitly.

New:

- **`GET /missions/{id}/report`**: structured, human-readable report per mission — goal, status,
  score; the mission-level **final output** (kept separate from per-task outputs, since tasks are
  the steps and the mission is the deliverable); a per-task breakdown (title, ant, status,
  elapsed, readable output, and the *why* for failed/skipped/blocked tasks); **tangible changes**
  (every patch proposal the mission created, its file, reason, and current state — awaiting
  approval / approved / applied to disk / rejected, with apply errors); pending-approval count;
  sources saved; and **problems** — including `patch_proposal_parse_failed`, the silent killer
  where the coder did work but its proposal never reached the approval queue.
- **Plain-English task outputs**: coder results (raw JSON patch sets) are translated to
  "Proposed modify to src/... : reason" lines server-side (`ApiHost.ReadableTaskOutput`);
  other ants' prose passes through; malformed output falls back to raw text.
- **Mission Report modal**: "View Result" on any completed job now renders the structured report
  — status in words, final output, tangible-changes list with a pointer into Approvals,
  problems, and an expandable per-task list — instead of the raw CLI text (which remains the
  fallback for legacy jobs without a mission id).
- **Autonomy runs are inspectable**: each row in Recent Autonomous Runs gains a **View** button
  opening the same mission report, so every unattended run answers "what did it actually do,
  and did anything tangible come out of it?" in one click.
- **`SqliteMemory`**: `ListPatchProposalsForMission` / `ListApprovalRequestsForMission`
  (secret-free, per-mission).
- **Tests**: `ReportTests` — coder-JSON translation, empty-proposal wording, malformed-output
  fallback, prose passthrough. `InternalsVisibleTo("Anthill.Tests")` added to Anthill.Api.

Fixed (Colony canvas + Autonomy page housekeeping):

- **Ant/Queen hover tooltips showed activity over 100% and not live data.** Three bugs, one of
  them structural: (1) an operator-precedence error in the animation loop —
  `(colonyActivity[ant]||0-n.activity)` parses as `colonyActivity || (0-activity)`, accumulating
  activity unboundedly every frame; (2) the activity source was "this ant's share of all tasks"
  (including finished ones), not a live reading; and (3) — the structural one — **task rows were
  only persisted at mission start (before tasks exist) and mission end**, so `/graph` had no
  nodes at all while a mission ran; every mid-run number the canvas ever showed was stale data
  from the previous completed mission. Fixed end to end: the Queen now persists the planned task
  DAG before execution and upserts each task on every status transition (started → live
  "running"; complete/failed/skipped on finalize — new `SqliteMemory.SaveTask`), and the canvas
  computes activity from those current task states each poll (running = 100%, queued work = 35%,
  idle = 0%), clamped to [0,1] everywhere. Signal particles, node glow, the hover panel, and the
  task-DAG dataflow arrows now reflect what the colony is doing *right now* — the graph poll
  tightened from 5s to 2.5s to match.
- **Colony canvas sharpened**: the canvas now renders at the display's real pixel density
  (devicePixelRatio-scaled backing store, logical-coordinate drawing) — crisp nodes, edges, and
  labels on HiDPI screens instead of the previous blurry 1x upscale.
- **Autonomy tables no longer grow the page unboundedly**: the Objectives and Recent Autonomous
  Runs boxes are collapsible (click the header) and cap at ~20 rows with their own scrollbar and
  sticky column headers.
- **Docs housekeeping**: README brought up to date with everything shipped since v1.8.12
  (Concurrency/Governor status card, Score column, Mission Report views, `/missions/{id}/report`
  in the API reference, autonomy-knob pointers), and a pre-commit checklist added at the top of
  this file so the docs stay true on every release.

No schema change, no config change.

## v1.8.14 — Phase 4 autonomy: the learning loop

Mission outcomes now feed back into what the Director chooses to work on. Design per operator
review: read-time bias (stored priorities never drift — same philosophy as Phase 3 aging) and
auto-pause retirement with explicit events (never delete; a human reviews and resumes).

New:

- **Per-objective success EMA** (`objectives.success_ema`, schema v10 → v11, additive migration):
  every recorded run folds its mission success score into an exponential moving average
  (`autonomy_score_ema_alpha`, default 0.3; an unscored/failed run counts as 0). Always recorded
  — even with learning disabled — so history exists the moment it's turned on.
- **Selection bias** (`Autonomy/ObjectiveLearning.cs`, new): at selection time an objective's
  EMA adds a bounded, linear bias to its effective priority — EMA 1.0 → +`autonomy_priority_bias_max`
  (default 2), EMA 0.5 → 0, EMA 0.0 → −max. Computed read-time in
  `SqliteMemory.EffectivePriority` alongside Phase 3 aging; new objectives (null EMA) are
  unbiased. Operator numbers in the backlog stay authoritative.
- **Stale retirement**: after `autonomy_retire_min_runs` (default 5) runs, an objective whose EMA
  is below `autonomy_retire_score_threshold` (default 0.25) is auto-paused — it keeps running
  without producing value.
- **Loop retirement**: if the last `autonomy_loop_window` (default 4, 0 = off) generated goals
  are all near-identical (≥ `autonomy_dedupe_similarity` keyword overlap — the exact metric the
  Strategist's dedup uses), the objective is auto-paused. Catches the charter-fallback spiral:
  dedup already replaces repeat goals with the charter, so a true loop shows up as the same goal
  run after run.
- **Retirement = pause + event, never delete**: the Director emits an `objective_retired` event
  (code `stale_low_success` or `looping_goals`, with reason, EMA, and run count) and sets the
  objective to Paused, exactly like the existing failure circuit breaker. Resume from the
  Autonomy page after review. Retirement checks run on the director thread after each outcome is
  recorded, so nothing races the objective's own bookkeeping.
- **Config**: `autonomy_learning_enabled` (default true; false = exact Phase 3 behavior),
  `autonomy_priority_bias_max`, `autonomy_score_ema_alpha`, `autonomy_retire_min_runs`,
  `autonomy_retire_score_threshold`, `autonomy_loop_window` — all clamped, all in the settings
  whitelist; toggle + integer knobs editable from Settings → Colony.
- **Observability**: `/objectives` and the Autonomy page's backlog table gain a **Score** column
  (the EMA, color-coded); `autonomy_mission_finished` events and `/autonomy/status` include
  `success_ema` / `learning_enabled`.
- **Tests**: `LearningTests` — EMA seeding/smoothing/persistence, bias linearity and bounds,
  EMA-driven selection ordering (and its disappearance when learning is off), stale/loop/never
  retirement decisions.

## v1.8.13 — Fix: coder ant proposed Python patches regardless of the project's language

Reported from live use: send the colony an objective against this (C#) repo and the coder ant
comes back proposing Python. Root cause was leftover DNA from ANTHILL's original Python build
(`py.old/`) — three compounding biases, no model misbehavior:

- **CoderAnt's JSON format example showed a `.py` path** (`"file_path":
  "relative/path/to/file.py"`). Small local models imitate format examples very literally, so
  the example language became the answer language. Now a neutral `file.ext`, plus a new
  first-position rule: match the language/conventions of the files visible in context, and if no
  existing code is visible and the goal names no language, return an empty proposals list rather
  than guess.
- **FileAnt injected `anthill.py` as a candidate path** whenever a mission mentioned "anthill",
  "this script", or "main script" — a relic of the Python-era entry point that fed Python-flavored
  context to every downstream ant. Removed; candidate paths now come only from what the mission
  text actually names.
- **FileAnt's path-extraction regex couldn't see .NET paths**: its suffix list (`py|txt|md|...`)
  predated the port and omitted `cs|csproj|sln|props|targets` (and other patchable types:
  `sh|bat|ps1|cmd|go|rs|java|kt|rb|php|tf|hcl|sql`). A mission saying "fix
  src/Anthill.Api/ApiHost.cs" never surfaced that path as a read candidate. The list now matches
  `AnthillRuntime.PatchAllowedSuffixes`, so every file type the coder may patch is also one the
  file ant can spot and read — including the colony's own sources for self-modification missions.

No schema change, no API change, no config change.

## v1.8.12 — Phase 3 autonomy: concurrent missions + ResourceGovernor

The Director can now run up to `autonomy_concurrency` missions side by side (default 1 —
behavior is unchanged until the operator raises it; clamped 1–8). Design decisions per operator
review: strict-priority scheduling with anti-starvation aging, and a load/probe governor with
full VRAM tracking deferred to a later hardware-aware scheduler phase.

New:

- **`ResourceGovernor`** (`src/Anthill.Core/Autonomy/ResourceGovernor.cs`): sizes effective
  concurrency each cycle from the configured cap — and can only ever lower it. Signals:
  normalized CPU load per core (≥1.25 halves, ≥2.0 clamps to 1), available-memory fraction
  (≤20% halves, ≤10% clamps to 1), and an Ollama probe (`GET /api/version`, 15s cache —
  unreachable clamps to 1, ≥2.5s latency halves). Unreadable *host* signals fail open (skip);
  a dead *backend* fails safe (clamp to 1 — missions would fail anyway, don't multiply them).
  Skipped entirely when `use_ollama` is false, so offline installs are never clamped by it.
- **Concurrent Director loop** (`src/Anthill.Api/ColonyDirector.cs`): non-blocking launches with
  an in-flight table, reaped as jobs finish. Everything still happens on the one director thread
  (Strategist/BudgetGuard stay sequential by construction); the hard rails are re-checked before
  every individual launch. Stop/kill-switch now *drains*: no new launches, in-flight missions
  finish and are recorded, then the thread exits — nothing is ever left unrecorded.
- **Strict priority + aging** (`SqliteMemory.NextReadyObjectives`): slots fill with the
  highest-effective-priority distinct ready objectives; an objective never runs two missions at
  once. Effective priority = priority + 1 per `autonomy_aging_minutes` waited (default 30;
  0 = pure strict priority); longest-queued wins ties. Computed at read time — stored priorities
  never drift.
- **Config**: `autonomy_concurrency`, `autonomy_aging_minutes` — in `config.example.json`, the
  settings whitelist, `/settings`, and the Settings → Autonomy panel.
- **Observability**: `/autonomy/status` gains `concurrency_configured`/`concurrency_effective`,
  `governor_code`/`governor_reason`/`governor_signals`, `aging_minutes`, and `in_flight`;
  `autonomy_mission_started` events carry the governor verdict. Autonomy page: Concurrency KPI +
  In-flight and Governor rows.

Fixed (latent, pre-existing):

- **`Queen.LastMissionId` race**: with >1 job worker, a finishing worker could stamp its job with
  *another* worker's mission id. `Queen.RunMission` now reports the mission id through an
  `onMissionCreated` callback the moment the row is persisted, and `ApiJobRegistry` uses it —
  also making the mission id visible on the job while it's still running. `LastMissionId` remains
  for the single-mission CLI path.
- Job worker pool is sized `max(api_job_workers, autonomy_concurrency)` at boot so concurrent
  autonomous missions actually get worker slots instead of queueing behind each other.

Validation: `GovernorTests` (every clamp path, fail-open vs. fail-safe, tightest-constraint-wins,
throwing readers), multi-slot selection/aging tests in `AutonomyTests`, and an offline two-slot
Director run in `DirectorTests` asserting both objectives complete with distinct mission ids and
per-objective run records. Existing Phase 0–2 suites unchanged and still green.

## v1.8.11 — Fix: Autonomy page's Start/Stop (kill switch) froze the UI via infinite recursion

No schema change, no API change — pure front-end JS bug in `src/Anthill.Api/Ui/index.html`.
Reported live as "the web app and service crashes when you hit the kill switch in the autonomy
page." Reproduced by driving the real running instance directly: clicking the "■ Stop" kill
switch caused the browser tab to stop responding to input.

Root cause: `openAutonomy()` called `showPage('autonomy')` at its top, but `showPage()` itself
calls `PAGE_ENTER['autonomy']()` right after switching pages — and `PAGE_ENTER['autonomy']` was
wired to call `openAutonomy()` again. That's unbounded mutual recursion:
`openAutonomy → showPage → PAGE_ENTER.autonomy → openAutonomy → showPage → ...`. It fired on
*every* visit to the Autonomy page — including the periodic status refresh the page runs while
open — and threw `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded` hundreds of times per trigger
(confirmed live via the browser console). Each occurrence briefly pegs the JS main thread as it
unwinds thousands of stack frames, which is what made the tab appear to hang or "crash" right as
a click (like Stop) landed. `openAntConfig()` (the Ant Config page) had the exact same bug
pattern, not yet reported but fixed here too. The .NET backend was never actually affected —
`/health` and the Director's own stop/start logic kept working the entire time this was
happening; confirmed via `/autonomy/status` and the `autonomy_stopped`/`autonomy_started` event
log entries recording correctly through repeated live reproduction.

Fixed:

- **`openAutonomy()`**: no longer calls `showPage('autonomy')` — it's now a pure data-loader,
  correct since its only caller is `PAGE_ENTER['autonomy']`, which `showPage()` already invokes
  *after* switching to the page.
- **`openAntConfig()`**: same fix, same reasoning (its `showPage('antconfig')` call is gone; its
  second caller, the Ant Config "Reset" button, doesn't need a page-switch either since the user
  is already on that page when clicking Reset).

Validation:

- Reproduced and fixed live against the user's running LXC instance via direct browser
  automation: captured the exact `RangeError` stack trace from the browser console, hot-patched
  the corrected function into the live page, then repeated the same Start → Stop sequence with
  the patch active — no errors, no hang, instant response both times. `bash -n`/syntax not
  applicable (HTML/JS); confirmed by the live before/after test described above. Ship this build
  to make the fix permanent (the hot-patch only lived in that one browser tab's memory).

## v1.8.10 — Fix: LXC upgrade republish silently dropped the SQLite native library

No schema change. Bug found live re-running `deploy/lxc/setup.sh` on the user's LXC instance
immediately after the v1.8.9 ETXTBSY fix — the very first time a republish onto that install
directory ever ran to full completion. The service came up, then immediately crashed in a
restart loop:

```
Unhandled exception. System.TypeInitializationException: The type initializer for
'Microsoft.Data.Sqlite.SqliteConnection' threw an exception.
 ---> System.DllNotFoundException: Unable to load shared library 'e_sqlite3' or one of its
dependencies.
/opt/anthill/bin/e_sqlite3.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

Root cause: that same install directory had been publish-targeted several times across this
session's earlier v1.8.7/v1.8.8/v1.8.9 attempts, including at least one run that was killed
mid-bundle by the ETXTBSY bug itself. `dotnet publish` reused the leftover `obj/`/`bin`
incremental state from those prior (partially-failed) runs and decided the RID-specific SQLite
native asset (`e_sqlite3.so`) was already up to date — so it skipped copying it into the output
directory, even though it wasn't actually there. The resulting single-file binary builds, starts,
and immediately SIGABRTs the moment it touches the database.

Fixed:

- **`deploy/lxc/setup.sh`**: wipes `obj/`/`bin` for `Anthill.Cli`, `Anthill.Core`, and
  `Anthill.Api` immediately before every publish, so install/upgrade is always a from-scratch
  build rather than trusting incremental state that a prior interrupted run may have left
  inconsistent. Adds a post-publish check that fails loudly (with a clear error) if no
  `e_sqlite3` native library made it into the output directory, instead of letting it surface
  later as a silent SIGABRT crash loop under systemd.

Validation:

- Found via the user's real upgrade attempt on their LXC instance — full stack trace confirmed
  root cause precisely (`SqliteConnection..cctor` → `SQLitePCL.Batteries_V2.Init` →
  `DllNotFoundException`). Fix itself has **not been re-verified live** — no LXC/Proxmox host or
  dotnet SDK available in the environment this was authored in. `bash -n` syntax check passes.
  Confirm by re-running `bash deploy/lxc/setup.sh` and checking `ls /opt/anthill/bin/*e_sqlite3*`
  finds the native library, then that the service stays up (`systemctl status anthill`).

## v1.8.9 — Fix: LXC upgrade-in-place failed with "Text file busy"

No schema change. Bug found live re-running `deploy/lxc/setup.sh` to upgrade an already-running
LXC install to v1.8.8: `dotnet publish` failed with
`System.IO.IOException: Text file busy : '/opt/anthill/bin/anthill'` inside the `GenerateBundle`
MSBuild task.

Root cause: `setup.sh` republishes directly into `$INSTALL_DIR/bin`, which is exactly where the
systemd unit's `ExecStart` runs the binary from. .NET's single-file bundler does an in-place file
copy rather than write-to-temp-then-atomic-rename, and Linux refuses to open a currently-executing
binary for direct write access (`ETXTBSY`) — replacing a running program's file via `rename()` is
fine, overwriting it in place while it's executing is not. First-time installs never hit this
(nothing running yet); every subsequent upgrade-in-place did, 100% of the time.

Fixed:

- **`deploy/lxc/setup.sh`**: stops the `anthill` systemd unit immediately before the publish step
  (`systemctl stop anthill 2>/dev/null || true` — safe no-op on a first install, since the unit
  doesn't exist yet). The existing `systemctl restart anthill` at the end of the script already
  starts it back up regardless of whether it was freshly installed or stopped for an upgrade, so
  this was a one-line, symmetrical fix.

Validation:

- Found via the user's real upgrade attempt on their LXC instance — full MSBuild stack trace
  confirmed root cause precisely (`Microsoft.NET.HostModel.Bundle.Bundler.GenerateBundle` →
  `SafeFileHandle.Open` → `ETXTBSY`). Fix itself has **not been re-verified live** — no LXC/Proxmox
  host or dotnet SDK available in the environment this was authored in. `bash -n` syntax check
  passes. Confirm the fix by re-running `bash deploy/lxc/setup.sh` on the same instance and
  checking it completes without stopping mid-publish this time.

## v1.8.8 — Fix: provider Base URL override sent as a bare prefix, not a real endpoint

No schema change. Bug found live on a real LXC deployment: testing the OpenAI connection in
Settings → Providers failed every time with `ERROR: OpenAI request failed (404): `.

Root cause: the stored `base_url` override (`https://api.openai.com/v1`) was used as the literal
request URL in `OpenAiCompatibleClient`, with no path appended — so the request actually hit
`https://api.openai.com/v1`, not a real API route, and OpenAI correctly 404'd it. The value that
was stored is exactly how OpenAI's own SDKs define `base_url` (host + version prefix only, path
appended internally), so typing it that way into the override field is a completely reasonable
thing to do even though the field's placeholder shows the full path — the code should tolerate
both forms rather than silently breaking on one of them.

Fixed:

- **`OpenAiCompatibleClient.NormalizeEndpoint`** (covers OpenAI, Perplexity, and OpenRouter, which
  all share this client): if a configured endpoint doesn't already end with `/chat/completions`,
  it's appended automatically. Handles a trailing slash either way. Applied in the constructor, so
  it self-corrects for any already-stored override without needing a database fix or the user to
  re-save anything.
- **`AnthropicClient`**: previously didn't accept a `base_url` override at all —
  `ModelRouter.BuildKeyedClient`'s `"anthropic"` branch built the client with only the API key and
  model, silently discarding whatever was stored in `provider_credentials.base_url`. Now accepts
  an optional endpoint, normalized the same way (`/messages` appended if missing), wired through
  from `ModelRouter`.
- **`tests/Anthill.Tests/ProviderTests.cs`**: added `NormalizeEndpoint` coverage for both
  providers — bare prefix, full path, and either with/without a trailing slash — plus confirms
  `AnthropicClient` falls back to its documented default when no override is stored. Made both
  `NormalizeEndpoint` methods `public` (were `private`) specifically so this is directly
  unit-testable without a network call.

Validation:

- Found via live testing against a real running LXC instance (`10.10.10.60:8713`, connected via
  browser automation) — reproduced the exact failing request, read the actual response body
  (`ERROR: OpenAI request failed (404): `) and the stored `base_url` from `GET /providers`,
  confirmed the root cause by reading `OpenAiCompatibleClient`/`ModelRouter` against that data.
  The fix itself has **not yet been re-verified live** — no `dotnet` SDK available in the
  environment this was authored in. Brace/paren balance checked manually. Once deployed
  (`git pull && bash deploy/lxc/setup.sh` on the LXC box, or a new tagged release), re-run Test
  Connection on OpenAI and confirm it now succeeds.

## v1.8.7 — LXC deployment

No schema change. Second step of the container/LXC/Windows-Service deployment push (see
[docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md)) — a one-shot installer for a fresh Debian/Ubuntu-family
LXC container, Proxmox or otherwise.

Added:

- **`deploy/lxc/setup.sh`** — unattended installer/upgrader for a fresh Debian 12+/Ubuntu 22.04+
  LXC container. Installs the .NET 9 SDK if missing (Microsoft's apt repo, resolved dynamically
  from `/etc/os-release` rather than hardcoded to one distro/version, with a `dotnet-install.sh`
  fallback for distros/versions Microsoft's repo doesn't have an entry for), clones/updates the
  repo, publishes a self-contained `linux-x64` binary, creates a dedicated unprivileged system
  user, installs + enables the systemd unit, and starts it. Idempotent — re-running it is the
  upgrade path (pulls latest, republishes, restarts). Configurable via `ANTHILL_REPO_URL`,
  `ANTHILL_INSTALL_DIR`, `ANTHILL_SERVICE_USER` env vars.
- **`deploy/lxc/anthill.service.template`** — the systemd unit `setup.sh` installs, with the same
  hardening as the manual systemd install already documented in the README (`NoNewPrivileges`,
  `PrivateTmp`, `ProtectSystem=strict`, scoped `ReadWritePaths`), plus `Environment=ANTHILL_HOME`
  for unambiguous workspace resolution and a generated `/etc/anthill/token.env` for an optional
  static API token.
- No special LXC features (nesting, privileged mode) are required — this is a plain systemd
  service, not Docker-in-LXC, so `NetworkUtil`'s auto-detected reachable IP works with zero extra
  networking config (LXC containers get a real interface directly, unlike Docker's bridge
  default).
- **README**: new "Option E — LXC" under Deploy on Linux, quick-start + pointer to the full guide.
- **`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`**: §3 filled in — creating the container (Proxmox `pct` commands +
  generic LXD/incus note), installing, upgrading, customizing install location/service user,
  uninstalling. Roadmap table updated (LXC done, Windows Service next).
- **CI**: new `lint-lxc-installer` job — `shellcheck` (GitHub-hosted runners have it preinstalled)
  plus a `bash -n` syntax check on `deploy/lxc/setup.sh`.
- **Releases** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`, added after this version shipped): triggered by
  pushing a `vX.Y.Z` tag. A `verify-version` job fails loudly if the tag doesn't match
  `AnthillRuntime.Version` in the tagged commit, guarding against tagging before a version bump
  actually landed. Builds self-contained `linux-x64`/`win-x64` binaries and a versioned Docker
  image pushed to `ghcr.io/thexonexone/operation-anthill`, then opens a **draft** GitHub Release
  (never auto-published) with notes pulled from the matching `## vX.Y.Z` CHANGELOG section and
  the binaries/image attached. Also fixed the stray `YOUR_ORG`/`anthill-dotnet` placeholder repo
  references across `README.md` to the real `thexonexone/operation-anthill` URL and directory
  name. See [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md §4](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md#4-releases).

Validation:

- `bash -n deploy/lxc/setup.sh` passes (checked manually — no shellcheck available in the
  authoring environment, hence the new CI job to actually run it). Not run against a real LXC
  container; no LXC/Proxmox host available in the environment this was authored in. Try it on an
  actual container before trusting it in production, and watch the first CI run for the new
  shellcheck job.

## v1.8.6 — Container-style deployment: Docker, all-interfaces binding, env var config

No schema change. First step of ongoing work to make ANTHILL deployable like a normal home-lab
appliance — standalone Docker container today, LXC and Windows Service to follow (see
[docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md)).

Added:

- **Docker packaging** — `Dockerfile` (multi-stage: SDK build stage, framework-dependent publish
  onto the `aspnet:9.0` runtime image, non-root user, unauthenticated `/health`-backed
  `HEALTHCHECK`), `docker-compose.yml` (defaults to `network_mode: host` on Linux so the
  container is reachable at the host's real LAN IP, with a bridge-mode alternative documented for
  Windows/macOS Docker Desktop), and `.dockerignore`. No config file or token required to start —
  ANTHILL self-seeds a container-safe default `config.json` into the mounted `.anthill` volume on
  first boot.
- **All-interfaces binding by default** — `api_host` now defaults to `0.0.0.0` (was `127.0.0.1`)
  in both `AnthillConfig`'s default and every safety profile's forced override. The operator login
  was already the real security boundary (auth is forced on in every profile regardless of bind
  host), so this changes what a fresh container/LXC/service install looks like on first boot, not
  the actual security posture. Set `api_host` to `127.0.0.1` (or `ANTHILL_HOST=127.0.0.1`)
  explicitly for a localhost-only install.
- **`ANTHILL_HOST` / `ANTHILL_PORT` / `ANTHILL_OLLAMA_HOST` / `ANTHILL_OLLAMA_MODEL` env vars** —
  new highest-precedence overrides (win over `config.json`) in `AnthillRuntime.ProjectConfig`,
  so container/LXC/service deployments can be configured entirely from the outside. This also
  fixes a latent bug: the CLI's `--host`/`--port`/`--ollama-host`/`--ollama-model` flags
  previously wrote a static field that `AnthillRuntime.Initialize()` immediately overwrote from
  `config.json` a moment later inside `ApiHost.Run()`, silently ignoring the flags; they now set
  these same env vars instead, which survive.
- **`NetworkUtil.GetLikelyLanIPv4()`** (`Anthill.Core/Common/NetworkUtil.cs`) — cross-platform,
  no-network-traffic LAN IP auto-detection (local UDP "connect", no packet sent), used to print a
  real, clickable URL in the startup console banner and in `GET /status` (`reachable_ip` field)
  instead of the unusable `0.0.0.0` bind address, on both Linux and Windows.
- **Config hygiene**: `config.example.json` had a trailing comma making it invalid JSON — copying
  it verbatim per the documented Quick Start steps would silently fall back to all-default config
  with just a console warning easy to miss in a container. Fixed, and added the three Phase 2
  Strategist knobs (`autonomy_dedupe_similarity`, `autonomy_max_followups_per_run`,
  `autonomy_max_objective_depth`) that were missing from the example file.
- **`Anthill.sln` fix**: the solution file only registered `Anthill.Tests`; `Anthill.Cli`,
  `Anthill.Api`, and `Anthill.Core` were never top-level entries, so `dotnet build Anthill.sln`
  (as documented in the README) silently never built the actual CLI/API projects — only
  `build.sh`/`build.ps1`'s explicit direct-publish step did. Added all three so the documented
  build/IDE-open workflow matches what actually ships.
- **README**: Docker section expanded to include the full `docker-compose.yml` walkthrough (field
  table, bridge-mode alternative for Windows/macOS Docker Desktop, plain `docker build`/`docker
  run` commands, Dockerfile summary, upgrade steps) instead of just pointing at
  `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`; Security Model table gained a network-binding row; Windows Service section
  flagged as pending proper SCM integration (planned next, see `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` §4); CI badge
  added.
- **CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, previously an empty placeholder): now runs on every push/PR
  to `main` (and manually via `workflow_dispatch`) — `dotnet build`/`dotnet test` on Linux and
  Windows, a self-contained `linux-x64` publish + `--selftest` run, and a Docker build + container
  boot smoke test that polls the `HEALTHCHECK` status and hits `GET /health` directly. This is the
  actual "does this work" signal going forward, since neither a .NET SDK nor a Docker daemon is
  available in the environment these changes were authored in.

Validation:

- Manual review only — no `dotnet` SDK or Docker daemon was available in the environment this
  change was authored in, so `docker build`/`docker compose up` and `dotnet build`/`dotnet test`
  have **not** been run against this change. Brace/paren balance checked by hand on every edited
  `.cs` file; `config.example.json` re-validated as parseable JSON. Run `dotnet build && dotnet
  test`, then `docker compose up -d --build` and confirm the console banner prints a real LAN IP,
  before relying on this in production.

## v1.8.5 — Autonomy Phase 2: Strategist

No schema change. Mission goals for the 24/7 Colony Director are now LLM-generated per objective
instead of charter-as-goal, with dedup against recent mission history and capped self-enqueued
follow-up objectives. See [docs/AUTONOMY.md](docs/AUTONOMY.md) for the full design.

Added:

- **`Anthill.Core.Autonomy.Strategist`** — turns an objective + recent `autonomy_runs` history +
  top pheromone trails into a concrete mission goal via a new `strategist` model-router role.
  Always computes the deterministic charter-as-goal fallback first; any router failure, missing
  router, or unparseable response falls back to it — never blocks or throws. `StrategistResult`
  reports `Source` (`"strategist"` or `"fallback"`) for auditability.
- **Dedup** — rejects a generated goal that's a near-duplicate of a recent completed/partial run
  for the same objective (`TextUtil.ExtractKeywords` containment-ratio overlap, threshold
  `autonomy_dedupe_similarity`, default `0.8`); a rejected goal falls back to the charter goal.
- **Follow-up objectives** — the Strategist can propose follow-ups in its JSON response;
  `ColonyDirector` saves them only after a successful mission, capped by
  `autonomy_max_followups_per_run` (default `1`) and `autonomy_max_objective_depth` (default `3`,
  walked via new `SqliteMemory.ObjectiveDepth`). Follow-ups inherit `ParentObjectiveId` and run at
  `Priority - 1`.
- **New config knobs** (all fail-closed): `autonomy_dedupe_similarity`,
  `autonomy_max_followups_per_run`, `autonomy_max_objective_depth`.
- **`ColonyDirector.RunObjectiveOnce`** rewritten to call `Strategist.GenerateGoal`; logs
  `goal_source`/`strategist_notes` on `autonomy_mission_started` and `follow_ups_created` on
  `autonomy_mission_finished`. Writes remain queue-only — the Strategist only chooses the next
  mission, never applies patches.
- **UI: Autonomy page** *(admin only)* — Director status card (start/stop, budgets, kill switch),
  objectives backlog editor (add/pause-resume/reprioritize/delete), and a recent-runs table
  showing goal source and outcome per run.

Validation:

- Offline `StrategistTests` cover the no-router fallback path (never blocks/throws) and
  `ObjectiveDepth` walking/edge cases. The LLM-driven generation/dedup paths require a live
  provider and aren't testable offline.
- Manual review only — no `dotnet` SDK was available in the environment this change was authored
  in, so this release has **not** been compiled or run. Run `dotnet build`/`dotnet test`, then
  exercise the Autonomy page end-to-end (add an objective, start the Director, confirm a run
  appears with a goal source) before shipping.

## v1.8.4 — Model provider connections

Schema bumped to **v10** (new `provider_credentials` table, migration `model_provider_connections`).
Ants can now be routed to paid cloud model providers — OpenAI (ChatGPT), Anthropic (Claude),
Perplexity, and OpenRouter — alongside free local Ollama, with API keys managed from the console.

Added:

- **`provider_credentials` table** — one row per external provider. The API key is sealed at rest
  with the existing AES-256-GCM `FieldCipher` (same key resolution as other encrypted columns:
  `ANTHILL_ENCRYPTION_KEY` env var, else an auto-generated 0600 workspace key file) and is never
  read back over the API; only a `configured` boolean, `enabled` flag, optional base-URL override,
  and last-verification status are ever exposed.
- **Real provider clients** (`Anthill.Core.Models.ProviderClients`) — `OpenAiCompatibleClient`
  (shared by OpenAI, Perplexity, and OpenRouter, which all speak the same `{model, messages}` →
  `choices[0].message.content` contract) and `AnthropicClient` (Messages API, `x-api-key` header,
  `content[]` block array). Both fail closed with `ERROR:` sentinel strings on missing keys,
  auth failures, timeouts, or transport errors, matching `OllamaClient`'s existing contract so the
  rest of the colony (retries, pheromone scoring, event logging) needs no changes.
- **`ProviderCatalog`** — static metadata (display name, free/paid kind, curated model list, key
  help URL, default endpoint) for every known provider, driving both the API's `/providers/catalog`
  response and the console's dropdowns.
- **`ModelRouter` keyed-client routing** — OpenAI/Anthropic/Perplexity/OpenRouter clients are built
  fresh on every call (not cached like Ollama's) so a rotated or removed key takes effect
  immediately without a process restart.
- **New endpoints**: `GET /providers/catalog`, `GET /providers`, `POST /providers` (upsert — a
  blank `api_key` on update leaves the stored key untouched), `DELETE /providers/{provider}`,
  `POST /providers/{provider}/test` (fires one live probe call through the real routing path and
  records the verification result). Gated by two new permissions, `read_providers` and
  `manage_providers`, both admin-only like `manage_settings`/`manage_users`.
- **Settings → Providers tab** — a card per provider with API-key input, optional base-URL
  override, Save / Test Connection / Remove actions, and a status pill (not connected / connected /
  verified / verification failed).
- **Ant Config provider + model routing** — each caste's model route editor now has a Provider
  selector (Ollama or any connected external provider) in addition to the existing model picker;
  saving writes `{provider, model}` into `model_routes` exactly as before.

Validation:

- Manual review only — no `dotnet` SDK was available in the environment this change was authored
  in, so this release has **not** been compiled or run. Run `dotnet build` and exercise
  `POST /providers`, `POST /providers/{provider}/test`, and an Ant Config route change before
  shipping.

## v1.8.3 — Enterprise shell UI

No schema change. The web console is rebuilt as a full enterprise-grade shell; all existing API
endpoints, auth, and backend behaviour are unchanged.

Added:

- **Left navigation rail** — 240 px expanded / 60 px icon-only collapsed, toggled by the **‹**
  button; collapse state persisted in `localStorage`. Eight nav items with icons: Overview, Colony,
  Missions, Event Log, Pheromones, Ant Config, Settings, Users.
- **8 routed pages** — `showPage(id)` swaps the active page, updates the nav active state, updates
  the header title, and fires a per-page `PAGE_ENTER` callback. All former modal overlays are now
  full pages:

  | Page | Replaces |
  |------|---------|
  | **Overview** | *(new)* — KPI grid, mission dispatch, recent jobs, live event feed |
  | **Colony** | Canvas page (unchanged layout; canvas now fills `#colony-canvas-area`) |
  | **Missions** | *(new)* — dedicated dispatch + full job history |
  | **Event Log** | `log-modal` overlay |
  | **Pheromones** | `phero-modal` overlay |
  | **Ant Config** | `antcfg-modal` overlay |
  | **Settings** | `settings-overlay` |
  | **Users** | `users-modal` overlay |

- **Fixed top header (50 px)** containing: page title (left), active mission goal + status dot
  (centre), model badge / connection badge / approval bell / logout button (right). The approval
  bell is always visible regardless of active page; clicking it navigates to Colony and scrolls
  to the Approvals card.
- **KPI cards on Overview** — Model Calls, Tasks Done, Events, Approvals; updated by the same
  `pollStatus()` that drives the Colony sidebar (both sets of stat elements are kept in sync).
- **Three mission dispatch inputs** — Colony canvas bar (`mission-input`), Missions page
  (`ms-mission-input`), Overview page (`ov-mission-input`); all feed the same `dispatchMission()`
  function and `enableInput()` locks/unlocks all three simultaneously.
- **Canvas mouse coordinate fix** — `mousedown`, `mousemove`, `mouseup`, `dblclick`, and `wheel`
  handlers now derive canvas-local coordinates via `canvas.getBoundingClientRect()` instead of the
  former `e.clientY - 50` hardcode. Hit-testing and zoom-pivot are accurate at every zoom level and
  nav-rail state.
- **Canvas resize fix** — `resize()` reads from `document.getElementById('colony-canvas-area')`
  (the flex container) instead of the former `#cw` element, so the canvas fills its area exactly
  regardless of sidebar widths.
- **Keyboard shortcuts** — `Ctrl+K` focuses the mission input on Colony; `Ctrl+L` navigates to
  Event Log; `Escape` closes the result overlay and rename popover.
- **`ov-jobs-list` / `ov-feed-list`** — the Overview page renders job lists and the live event
  feed (capped at 20 entries) from the same poll functions (`pollJobs`, `pollEvents`) that drive
  the Colony sidebar; no additional polling.
- **Card collapse** — every card in the Colony sidebars has a **▾** toggle; collapsed state is
  persisted in `localStorage` keyed by card id.
- **Result overlay** — position-fixed over the entire shell, shown when viewing a job result;
  includes Copy, Refresh, and Close controls.

Changed:

- All event IDs and API calls are **unchanged** — only the surrounding layout changed.
- `pollJobs()` now renders to three containers: `jobs-list` (colony left), `ov-jobs-list`
  (overview), `ms-jobs-list` (missions page).
- `pollEvents()` renders to `feed-list` (colony right) and `ov-feed-list` (overview, capped at 20).
- `pollStatus()` updates both `s-calls/tasks/events/approvals` (colony) and the `ov-*` equivalents.
- `applyRoleVisibility()` now also hides/shows nav items and the approval bell per role, not just
  page-level controls.

Validation:

- ID audit: all 143 required element IDs verified present in the final `index.html` (automated
  check with PowerShell regex pass).
- JS balance: brace count delta = 0; backtick count even (no unclosed template literals).
- No unreplaced CSS/JS/HTML placeholder markers; single `<style>` and `<script>` block.
- All original API endpoints and auth flow verified unchanged (no backend edits in this release).

## v1.8.2 — Live colony console + operator accounts

Schema bumped to **v9**. The web console becomes a fully operable control plane, and the shared
API token is replaced by real password-based operator accounts with roles.

Added:

- **Operator accounts + roles (replaces token-only web auth)**: the console is now secured by
  password login, not a shared API key. First run shows a one-time setup screen that creates the
  initial **administrator**; thereafter everyone signs in with a username/password and receives an
  in-memory **session** (12-hour sliding expiry, dropped on restart). Two roles:
  - **Administrator** — full control, including user management.
  - **Mission Coordinator** — may *only* send missions to the Queen and read the event logs (plus
    live status to watch them); everything else is denied at the API and hidden in the UI.

  Passwords are salted **PBKDF2-SHA256** (120k iterations), verified in constant time. New `users`
  table (schema v9, migration `user_accounts`); endpoints `GET /auth/status`, `POST /auth/{setup,
  login,logout}`, `GET /auth/me`, and `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /users`. A 👥 Users management page
  lets admins create accounts, assign roles, reset passwords, enable/disable, and delete. Changing a
  user's password, role, or status immediately revokes their active sessions, and the last remaining
  administrator can never be demoted, disabled, or deleted. CLI recovery: `--add-user <u> <p> [role]`
  and `--set-password <u> <p>`.
- **`ANTHILL_API_TOKEN` is now optional** (and no longer required to boot). If set (≥ 32 chars) it
  acts as a programmatic **admin** bearer for scripts/CI; otherwise authentication is purely account-based.
- **Live, actionable console** (same deep-navy/yellow theme):
  - **Editable settings** — Ollama host/model, per-role model routes, capability gates, limits, and
    autonomy budgets are all editable from the page and persisted to `config.json`
    (`GET/POST /settings`). Whitelisted keys only; hard security boundaries stay file-controlled.
  - **Movable / renamable / recolorable ants** — drag to arrange the anthill, double-click to rename,
    set per-caste accent colours and model routes from a dedicated **Ant Configuration** page. Layout
    persists server-side (`GET/PUT /ui/state`, stored in `.anthill/ui_state.json`).
  - **Filterable Event Log** — by ant, event type, severity (errors/alarms), and time window, plus
    text search (`GET /events/json`).
  - **Pheromone Memory page** — strength table with success/failure/net counts and one-click pruning
    of weak and failure-dominant trails (`GET /pheromones/json`, `POST /pheromones/prune`).

Validation:

- `dotnet test`: **52/52** pass. Self-test **15/15** on a fresh database (migration ledger at 9 entries).
- Live HTTP smoke test: first-run setup, login, role gating (coordinator blocked from `/users`,
  `/settings`, `/pheromones/json`), session revocation on password change, logout, last-admin
  protection, and CLI password recovery all verified.

## v1.8.1 — spec-ingestion + autonomy Phases 0–1

Schema bumped to **v8**. Autonomy is fail-closed and off by default.

Added:

- **Long-input / specification-ingestion handling**: mission goals over `long_input_threshold`
  are split into bounded, non-critical section-analysis tasks (run in parallel), a synthesis
  task, then verification. A failed section degrades the mission to Partial instead of aborting
  it. New `Task.Critical` flag generalises fault-tolerant fan-in. Config: `spec_ingestion_enabled`,
  `long_input_threshold`, `max_section_chars`, `max_section_tasks`.
- **Autonomy Phase 0 (rails)**: `objectives` backlog + `autonomy_runs` audit-trail tables,
  domain models, durable kill switch (`.anthill/STOP` + in-process flag), rate `BudgetGuard`,
  and the run-outcome circuit breaker. Config: `autonomy_enabled`, `autonomy_poll_seconds`,
  `autonomy_max_missions_per_hour`, `autonomy_max_missions_per_day`, `autonomy_max_consecutive_failures`.
- **Autonomy Phase 1 (Director loop, MVP)**: `ColonyDirector` works the backlog one mission at
  a time (charter-as-goal; the LLM Strategist is Phase 2), queue-for-review writes only.
  `--autonomous` boot flag and a control plane: `GET /autonomy/status`, `POST /autonomy/{start,stop}`,
  `GET /autonomy/runs`, and `/objectives` CRUD.

Fixed:

- Self-test now passes 15/15 on a **fresh** database: system/sentinel missions are seeded so
  event/message probes satisfy the `events → missions` foreign key on a clean install.

## v1.8.0 — .NET / native C++ hybrid migration

Language and platform migration of the v1.7.1 scheduler-hardening checkpoint from Python to
an idiomatic .NET 8 (C#) solution with a native C++20 compute kernel. Behaviour is preserved;
the harness gains a service-grade runtime, encryption at rest, and a caching speed layer.

Added:

- Native C++20 compute kernel (`native/anthill_kernel`) exposing a C ABI for pheromone
  reinforcement/decay, mission scoring, and dependency-graph cycle detection, bound via P/Invoke
  (`Native/NativeKernel.cs`) with a bit-identical managed fallback when the library is absent.
- AES-256-GCM field encryption for sensitive columns at rest (`Security/FieldCipher.cs`),
  keyed from `ANTHILL_ENCRYPTION_KEY` or an auto-generated owner-only workspace key file.
- `IMemoryCache` read-through speed layer over hot memory reads with generation-based invalidation.
- xUnit test suite: scheduler regressions, security regressions, and native-kernel equivalence.
- `Anthill.Cli` (`anthill`) with `--mission`, `--api`, `--selftest`, `--status`, `--config`, `--routes`.
- Reworked, animated colony console UI (Queen core, branching task tunnels, pheromone trails, live events).

Changed:

- `anthill/runtime.py` (7,177 lines) decomposed into a structured `Anthill.Core` class library;
  the FastAPI app became an ASP.NET Core minimal-API host (`Anthill.Api`).
- Pheromone trail strength updates remain exact (`round(strength + delta, 4)` clamped); mission
  scoring and cycle detection now run through the native kernel.
- Database access moved to `Microsoft.Data.Sqlite` with WAL, busy timeout, foreign keys, fully
  parameterised statements, and indexes on the hottest lookups.
- Version bumped to **1.8.0** to mark the language migration (schema version unchanged at 7).

Preserved (v1.6.4 / v1.7.x security + scheduler invariants):

- API token strength validation and constant-time comparison at boot.
- Failed-auth rate limiter (counts failures only); mission submission rate limiting.
- Security headers on every response; no public docs/OpenAPI endpoints.
- SSRF/local/private/non-http(s) URL filtering before agents or source records see a URL.
- Prompt-injection system-boundary prefix on every agent prompt.
- SQLite file hardening and automatic pre-mission DB backup.
- Tool gates (shell, file writing, patch application, web search) fail closed by default.
- Scheduler ownership of dependency validation, ready/blocked/skipped transitions, bounded
  retries, duplicate-id safety, lifecycle metadata, and metadata-first `task-graph-v2` export.
- Default graph export excludes full result summaries; `read_graph_results` gates the full export.

Validation:

- Native kernel: builds with g++/CMake; behaviour verified against the Python contract.
- `dotnet build` / `dotnet test`: scheduler, security, and native-kernel suites.
- `anthill --selftest`: framework self-test harness (15 checks).

## v1.7.1 (Python, prior baseline)

Scheduler hardening checkpoint. See the original `anthill_v1_7_1_codex_handoff/CHANGELOG.md`
