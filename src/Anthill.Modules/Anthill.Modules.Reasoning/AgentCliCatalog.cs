/// <summary>
/// One installable command-line agent the colony can delegate to. v3.8.39.
///
/// These are the shipped, supported CLI forms of the commercial agents — Claude Code, Codex,
/// Gemini CLI, and the open ones beside them. They are not a workaround for an API: they are how
/// those vendors intend their agents to be driven from another program, which is why each one has
/// its own login command and keeps its own credentials.
///
/// THE CREDENTIAL RULE, and the reason this shape was chosen over any other:
///
/// Anthill never sees, stores, forwards or replays a vendor credential. The operator runs the
/// tool's own <see cref="AuthCommand"/> once, exactly as they would if Anthill did not exist, and
/// the tool holds its own session from then on. Anthill only ever starts a process. That is not a
/// limitation accepted for policy reasons — it is strictly stronger than a credential vault would
/// be: there is no secret in Anthill's database to leak, no token to refresh, and nothing to
/// re-authenticate when a vendor rotates its auth. An operator revokes access in the vendor's own
/// account settings and it is revoked here too, with no Anthill involvement at all.
///
/// Purely declarative, and deliberately so. Nothing here runs a process, touches PATH or reads a
/// filesystem — <see cref="AgentCliDiscovery"/> does that. A catalogue that probed on construction
/// could not be tested without installing five vendors' tools.
