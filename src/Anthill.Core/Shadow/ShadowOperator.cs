/// v2.17.0 (NORTH_STAR Phase 7 — Shadow Operations &amp; Operator Qualification, Stage 1).
///
/// Shadow mode is the qualification gate before V3.0 grants any real authority: ANTHILL observes a
/// real incident and produces a full recommendation — diagnosis, proposed action, chosen skill, risk
/// score, predicted outcome, verification plan, rollback plan — and then STOPS. It never executes.
/// The operator later records what was actually done and whether the recommendation was correct, and
/// <see cref="QualificationScoreboard"/> turns those pairs into reliability metrics.
///
/// This engine is deterministic C#: it assembles the bundle from the already-shipped subsystems
/// (<see cref="RiskEngine"/> v2.14, <see cref="VerificationPolicy"/> v2.12, the <see cref="SkillRegistry"/>
/// v2.13, and <see cref="RecoveryOrchestrator"/> v2.14) rather than inventing parallel judgment, so a
/// shadow recommendation is reproducible and never depends on a model at decision time.
