/// (Queen finalization ×2, the Director's row re-derivation, restored-mission listing, objective
/// verification, candidate promotion) — and they could disagree, because task rows lack fields the
/// live path uses, and one caller resolved the outcome MID-mission while status was still Running
/// (which is why v2.23's route registration never actually registered anything).

/// <see cref="MissionEvaluator.Evaluate"/>; the result is persisted BEFORE completion is published;
/// and every downstream positive path consumes the persisted record. The old helpers survive only
