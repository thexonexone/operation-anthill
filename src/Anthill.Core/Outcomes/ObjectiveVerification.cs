/// v2.24.0 Phase C5: "was the goal met", on top of "did a verifier pass".
///
/// <see cref="MissionVerification"/> answers whether the mission ran a verification step that
/// returned a pass. That is necessary and not sufficient: a mission whose goal was "add a
/// CHANGELOG entry" can plan a researcher and a builder, produce a description of the change,
/// have the verifier legitimately pass — the tasks all did what they said — and deliver no file
/// change at all. Every gate downstream then reads `completed_verified`.
///
/// This adds a deliverable check. It is deliberately **additive**: the interim gate remains the
/// floor, and this can only ever narrow what counts as verified. Nothing that fails today can newly
/// pass because of this type.
///
/// It is also deliberately **modest**. Deciding "was the goal met" in general is a judgment call,
/// and a model asserting it is exactly the kind of evidence v2.19.0 stopped accepting. So the only
/// claim made here is one that can be checked deterministically: **when a goal plainly asks for a
/// file change, a file change must have been proposed.** Goals whose intent cannot be read fall
/// back to the interim gate alone — an unreadable goal must not be able to fail a mission that
/// otherwise verified, because that would punish work for the phrasing of its request.
