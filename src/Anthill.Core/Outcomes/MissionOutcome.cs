/// v2.19.0 Stage 2 — the canonical outcome vocabulary, and the single predicate that decides

/// WHY THIS EXISTS
/// ---------------
/// Before this release <c>ColonyDirector.ReadOutcome</c> computed
/// <c>var success = status is "complete" or "partial";</c> and that one flag drove four separate
/// consequences: objective success EMA, autonomous follow-up creation, objective lifecycle
/// closure, and AUTO-APPLY of patches. A partially-failed mission therefore reinforced learning
/// and could automatically apply code.
///
/// Combined with the executor marking every non-throwing task complete (see
/// docs/ADR-ADAPTIVE-MISSION-RUNTIME.md §2.1), an agent that reported <c>failed_retryable</c>
/// could drive an automatic code change. That is the defect this predicate closes.
///
/// Every positive path must ask <see cref="IsPositiveSuccess"/>. There is deliberately no second
/// way to spell it.
