/// <summary>
/// v3.4.0 (ADR-006) — the names of the tools that EXIST, and the names contracts reference that do
/// not exist yet.
///
/// Why this needs to be written down. Tool names were strings scattered across three unrelated
/// places: <c>Queen.BuildToolRegistry</c> (what is registered), <c>ToolAuthorization</c> (what each
/// role may dispatch), and the specialist <c>AntExecutionContract</c>s (what each role declares).
/// Nothing compared them, and they had drifted:
///
///   - every specialist contract forbids <c>"shell"</c> and <c>"write_file"</c>. Neither is a tool.
///     The real names are <c>shell_command</c> and <c>write_text_file</c>, so those forbid-lists
///     have never denied anything. They looked like a security boundary and were decoration —
///     harmless only because <see cref="ToolAuthorization.MissionAgentForbidden"/> happened to cover
///     the same tools under their correct names.
///   - five contracts allow tools nobody has built. <c>ToolAuthorization</c> SHORT-CIRCUITS on
///     contract presence: a role with a contract may use its <c>AllowedTools</c> and nothing else.
///     So <c>tester</c>, whose only allowed tool is real, works — while <c>soldier</c>, <c>medic</c>,
///     <c>archivist</c> and <c>scribe</c> are each allowed exactly one tool that does not exist, and
///     are therefore allowed nothing at all.
///
/// That second point is the long-standing "core-ant contracts are blocked on tool-inventory
/// evidence" note in the roadmap. This is the evidence, and it is now executable rather than a
/// recollection.
///
/// Deliberately NOT the registry itself. The registry holds what a given run registered, which
/// depends on config gates — <c>list_directory</c> is absent when file tools are off. This is the
/// build's vocabulary: every name a tool could have, gate or no gate. A contract must be checkable
/// without standing up a runtime.

    ///                          have added a call path without adding a capability.

    ///                          IngestMemoryCandidates already consumes them. Building it would have
