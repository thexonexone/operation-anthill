/// The exit gate this serves is worth quoting: "an agent asked a repository question CALLS A TOOL;
/// it does not receive a pre-stuffed context blob." So the index is never injected into a prompt —
/// it sits behind this, and the agent spends a turn to ask. That costs a round trip and buys the
/// thing that matters: the agent decides what it needs to see, and the context holds an answer
/// rather than a repository.
///
/// Distinct from <see cref="SearchWorkspaceTool"/>, which reads file CONTENT. This answers
/// structural questions — which languages, how many files, where does anything named like this live
/// — without opening a single file, because the index already knows.
///
/// Every result is bounded and carries its revision, so an excerpt an agent acts on can be traced.
