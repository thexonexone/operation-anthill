/// Which tool outcomes are DETERMINISTIC EVIDENCE. v3.8.20 (ADR-004).
///
/// WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY HERE. v3.8.19 shipped the evidence store with no producer, and the
/// obvious candidate turned out to be a mirage: <c>VerificationRunner</c> — which owns
/// <c>BuildVerifier</c> and <c>TestVerifier</c>, both genuinely deterministic — has NO PRODUCTION
/// CALL SITE. It is constructed only by tests. The one bundle production does build,
/// <c>LearningRecorder.MissionEvidenceBundle</c>, declares <c>Deterministic: false</c>. So at
/// v3.8.19 the colony produced no deterministic evidence anywhere, and a store waiting for the
/// verification framework to be wired up would have waited indefinitely.
///
/// Where deterministic checks DO run in production is here: <c>run_allowlisted_check</c> is the
/// tester ant's only execution surface, it runs a declared command from a catalog with a fixed
/// argument list, and its exit code is a fact. Rerun it on the same tree and it answers the same.
/// That is the definition, so that is the evidence.
///
/// THE LIST IS SHORT AND CLOSED ON PURPOSE. A tool qualifies only if repeating it on unchanged
/// inputs must give the same answer. <c>web_search</c> does not — the internet changes.
/// <c>shell_command</c> does not — it runs whatever it was handed. <c>read_text_file</c> reports
/// state rather than testing a claim. Being generous here would put "the ant looked at a file" into
/// the same table as "the test suite passed", which is the confusion the whole deterministic flag
/// exists to prevent.
