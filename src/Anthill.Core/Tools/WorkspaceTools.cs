/// <summary>
/// v3.5.0 — search the workspace an agent is actually working in.
///
/// This is the first of the two tools that were DECLARED by a contract and never built. The cost of
/// that was concrete rather than theoretical: <c>ToolAuthorization</c> short-circuits on contract
/// presence, so <c>ui_cartographer</c> — a role whose entire purpose is mapping a repository — was
/// allowed exactly three tools, one of which did not exist, and could therefore dispatch nothing.
/// It ran and produced no work, which reads as a weak model rather than a missing tool.
///
/// Deliberately NOT an index. v3.6.0 owns repository indexing and awareness; this is the bounded
/// literal-or-regex scan that a scoped workspace tool should be, and building it now means the role
/// works today rather than after another phase. When the index arrives it can back this same tool.
///
/// Every bound here exists because the OUTPUT goes into a model's context. An unbounded search over
/// a real repository does not fail — it returns forty thousand matches, fills the window, and the
/// agent loses the conversation it was having. Truncation is reported rather than silent, because a
/// model that cannot tell a complete result from a cut-off one will conclude the wrong thing.
