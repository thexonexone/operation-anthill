/// v3.3.0: this talks to Ollama's OPENAI-COMPATIBLE endpoint (<c>/v1/chat/completions</c>), not the
/// native <c>/api/generate</c>. One decision, three consequences, and the first is the reason:
///
/// 1. <c>/api/generate</c> HAS NO TOOL-CALL CHANNEL. It takes a prompt string and returns a
///    completion string, so a local model physically cannot ask to run a tool through it. Every
///    local agent loop, every self-improvement cycle, every "read this file then patch it" is
///    unreachable on that endpoint — not hard, unreachable. Function-calling local models
///    (Hermes, Qwen, Llama 3.x) emit OpenAI-shaped <c>tool_calls</c>, and this is where they land.
/// 2. It collapses a special case rather than adding one. Ollama now shares the exact request
///    projection, tool schema and response reader with OpenAI, LM Studio, vLLM, llama.cpp and
///    OpenRouter — so a tool-calling bug is fixed once for every provider, and the tests that
///    cover the shape cover all of them.
/// 3. Local stays first-class. No API key, no cost, no cloud round-trip; the only thing that
///    changed is the dialect it is asked in.
///
/// What is deliberately KEPT is the diagnostic that matters most here: a 404 from Ollama nearly
/// always means the model is not pulled, and saying so — with the exact <c>ollama pull</c> command
/// — is the difference between a two-second fix and an operator debugging their network.

         * schemas were correctly stripped — the model genuinely cannot use them — the model was
         * asked a question it could only guess at, and it answered "the system information tool
         * shows that the host is running Linux Ubuntu" having called nothing. Every layer behaved
         * correctly and the result was still a confident fabrication, because the route chose a
         * model that cannot do the job.
         *
         * Reroute rather than fail: an operator asking a question should get an answer from a model
         * that can actually look, not an error about routing tables. The substitution is RECORDED
         * in the reroute reason, because silently answering from a different model than configured
         * is its own kind of lie.
