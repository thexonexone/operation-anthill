/* ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   ANTHILL dashboard grid (v3.3.0) — the widget framework.

   Replaces the floating-panel workspace. The paradigm it removes: widgets as
   absolutely-positioned frames layered over the colony canvas, each carrying its
   own x/y/w/h, z-order, dock edge and tab group. That produced overlap, clipping
   at unexpected viewport sizes, and widgets stranded off-screen — and it made
   the Colony a background rather than a display.

   What is deliberately KEPT from the old engine, because it is the good part:
   a widget declares `render(el)` and mounts an EXISTING element by id. Every
   data renderer in app.js keeps writing to the same node it always wrote to.
   This framework changes where widgets sit, not what they contain — which is
   why a layout replacement does not become a rewrite of the whole console.

   SHIPPED here: hide/show, reorder, lock, reset, and layout persistence. These
   were originally deferred as "architecture supports them, not shipped" — but
   the workspace this replaces already HAD them, so deferring was not scoping,
   it was a capability regression. Persistence goes through the host's single
   ui_state writer; a second independent writer against the same document is how
   app.js and the old workspace used to discard each other's changes.

   Still NOT implemented: per-widget resize and pin. Both are size decisions and
   `size` is already data on the widget record, so they remain additive.

   * Size every widget to its content, so no card holds more empty space than it needs.

   * Measured, not inferred. Most "No jobs yet." messages come from the app's OWN renderers inside
   * adopted nodes, not from this framework's empty state — so asking "did I render a placeholder"
   * misses almost every case that matters. Actual content height is the only signal that sees both.
   *
   * This started as an empty-card fix and became a general one, because the screenshot showed the
   * real cause: a populated widget with 140px of content was also holding a 230px card, so the
   * FLOOR was padding the rows, not the idle widgets stretching them. Fitting every widget to its
   * content took ~11% off the dashboard's height. Grid rows still take the tallest card in the row,
   * which keeps bottoms aligned — ragged rows read as broken rather than dense.
   *
   * Runs after layout (rAF) because content height is meaningless before the browser has laid the
   * grid out.
   *
   * The floor for a quiet widget is COMPUTED here rather than declared in CSS. Two failed attempts
   * are the reason, and both are worth remembering:
   *
   *   - A fixed smaller floor (96px) is a guess about content that varies; it clipped four widgets
   *     whose one-line empty state rendered 81px tall.
   *   - Removing the floor — `min-height: 0` or `max-content` — collapses the grid row to 2px and
   *     the cards then overlap each other. `.dg-widget` sets `overflow: hidden`, which makes it a
   *     scroll container, and a scroll container contributes nothing to an `auto` row's height. The
   *     row must be given a definite size by someone; CSS cannot derive it.
   *
   * So JS, which has already measured the content, writes the exact height that content needs.
