/// The autonomous Colony Director. A long-lived supervisor that works the objective backlog:
/// budget + kill-switch check → pull ready objectives → run missions for them through the shared
/// job worker pool → record the outcomes → idle backoff → repeat.
///
/// Phase 2 added the LLM Strategist: instead of using the objective's charter verbatim every
/// cycle, it synthesises the next concrete goal from the charter + this objective's own recent
/// run history + colony pheromone memory, rejects near-duplicate goals, and — within a hard cap
/// — can enqueue follow-up objectives it discovers. It fails closed to the Phase 1 behaviour
/// (charter-as-goal) whenever routing is off or the model misbehaves, so the loop never blocks
/// or stalls on the LLM.
///
/// Phase 3 adds concurrency: up to <see cref="AnthillRuntime.AutonomyConcurrency"/> missions run
/// side by side, sized down each cycle by the <see cref="ResourceGovernor"/> when the host or
/// model backend is under pressure. Scheduling is strict priority with anti-starvation aging
/// (see <c>SqliteMemory.NextReadyObjectives</c>), and an objective never has two missions in
/// flight at once — which also keeps its run-outcome bookkeeping serial. All launching, reaping,
/// and outcome recording still happens on the single director thread, so BudgetGuard and
/// Strategist calls stay sequential by construction. Writes stay queue-for-review: the Director
/// only launches missions; it never approves or applies patches. The kill switch
/// (<see cref="AutonomyControl"/>) drains the loop: no new launches, in-flight missions finish
/// and are recorded, then the thread exits.
